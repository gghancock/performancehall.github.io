        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

        Node Configuration Instructions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>Plug the node into the lighting network and write down the ip address taped to the side of the node</p>

<p>On a Mac:<br />
Open System Preferences<br />
Go to the Network Preferences page<br />
Move the “Auditorium” Wi-Fi network<br />
Click on Advanced<br />
Go to the TCP/IP page<br />
In the drop down menu where it says “Configure IPv4” select “Manually”<br />
Give the computer an ip address of 192.169.0.199 (or any other ip address within the lighting network but not used by an entity on that network)<br />
Give the computer a Subnet Mask of 255.255.255.0<br />
Click OK and then click Apply<br />
Open Firefox<br />
Type in the ip address of the mode where you would enter a web address + /mini/<br />
For example, if the ip address is: 192.168.0.72, you would type in 192.168.0.72/mini/</p>

<p>There are only a few things that you should be changing in this screen, depending upon what you are configuring the node to do:</p>

<p>You can change whether the ports (DMX A and DMX B) output or input DMX by going to their respective pages within this screen by clicking on them and then selecting DMX in from the drop-down menu</p>

<p>You can change what DMX universe (set of 512 DMX channels–usually we’ll just be using universes one and two to give the hall a total of 1024 addressable channels of lighting control) each port corresponds to by changing the “Netslot” field value of each port along the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>To put a DMX port (A or B) in Universe 1, enter “1” for the “Netslot”. For Universe 2, you would enter 513 for the “Netslot”</p>

<p>If you reconfigure the node, make sure to change the label for each DMX port to reflect what it is doing (i.e. if you configure a port to be DMX in second universe, change the label to DMX IN U2).</p>

<p>Click Update to upadate the node with the changes you made. The password is 2606. Go back to the DMX A and DMX B pages to make sure the desired changes held.</p>

<p>After reconfiguring the node, reboot the node by unplugging it from ethernet and plugging it back in.</p>

<p>You’re done! To make your computer connect to the regular internet again, go back to the Configure IPv4 drop down menu in system preferences and change it back to “Using DHCP” and apply the changes.</p>

<p>Be sure to reconfigure the node to default (for output nodes, outputting universes 1 and 2 from their respective DMX ports) when striking the show.</p>
