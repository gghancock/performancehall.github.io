        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

    make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who visits

        Video Overflow Setup
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2016</span>

    <h1 id="setting-up-mezzanine-and-lobby-overflow-video-streams">Setting up Mezzanine and Lobby Overflow Video Streams</h1>

<h2 id="equipment">Equipment</h2>

<p>To set up a video feed for the Gidwitz Lobby Displays and the Mezzanine,
you will need the following equipment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>(2) Decimator</li>
  <li>(3) SDI Cable</li>
  <li>(2) XLR Cable</li>
  <li>(3) HDMI Cable</li>
  <li>(1) XLR-&gt;RCA Cable</li>
  <li>(1) 1/4”-&gt;XLR Cable</li>
  <li>(1) Haivision Encoder (stays in the Amp rack)</li>
  <li>(1) Haivision Decoder (borrowed from another space)</li>
  <li>(1) Long (25ft or more) Ethernet Cable (will need to be checked out from the cage)</li>
  <li>(n) Large Portable TV (located on the 11th floor, will need to be checked out from the cage)</li>
  <li>(n) Hai-vision Decoder Remote</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="foh-setup">FOH Setup</h2>

<p>If there is an external videographer, skip this section. If there is no videographer, we will need to use equipment from the cage.
Check out a video camera and a tripod and set them up next to the FOH desk. We recommend the Sony PMW-EX1R HD Video Camera.</p>

<p>Set up an audio feed for the videographer’s camera on the Venue with an AUX patched to an unused output(x).
This aux should include all live mics and digital audio channels.
Connect AUX-out(x) to the camera’s XLR-in and make sure the audio is routed to SDI-out on the camera.
Using the SDI cable, patch the camera into V40 at the FOH AVP under the desk.
Set up another AUX on the Venue (should be a copy of the first) so that it is patched to another unused output (y).</p>

<h2 id="amp-room-setup">Amp Room Setup</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Connect power to the Decimator.</li>
  <li>Patch V40 video output into Decimator SDI input using an SDI patch cable (these can be found on the wall and have a tube connection on one end and an SDI connection on the other).</li>
  <li>Connect the Decimator’s HDMI-out to the Haivision Encoder’s HDMI-&gt;DVI-in adapter using a short HDMI cable.
    <ul>
      <li>The encoder is located in the open slot in the rightmost rack towards the top, labeled ‘Performance Hall’. You can place the Decimator in this slot next to the encoders.</li>
      <li>To run the cable you will have to feed it through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Take output (y) you patched at the Venue from ‘Venue Outputs’ (center column in the amp room; APB-07; red and white labels) with ¼”-&gt;XLR cable, connect it to the XLR-&gt;RCA cable, and plug the RCA-outs into the RCA-ins at the back of the  encoder.
    <ul>
      <li>Again, feed the cable through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Run SDI from the Decimator’s SDI-out to SM console.</li>
</ul>

<p>Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&lt;-SDI-in, SDI-out(1)&lt;-SDI-in (make loop)</p>

<h2 id="stage-manager-console-setup">Stage Manager Console Setup</h2>
<p>Set up a second Decimator with SDI-in taken from the Amp Room SDI run (on the floor, a shelf, or table is fine as long as the cables aren’t a trip hazard).
Connect power to the Decimator, and send HDMI-out to Crestron panel’s HDMI-in using the second HDMI cable. Enter Technician Mode at Crestron panel (5540) and route “SM Input” to Lower Lobby, Auditorium, Theater East, and Theater West for overflow viewing.</p>

<p>Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&lt;-SDI-in</p>

<h2 id="theater-eastwest">Theater East/West</h2>
<p>Carefully remove the Decoder box from below the TV in either Theater West or Theater East. Make sure the disconnected cables are stable and accessible for reconnection during strike.
(When restoring these, take care with cable/port matches: Yellow Component cable -&gt; Yellow Component output, Black/Silver Audio cable -&gt; Red audio output)</p>

<h2 id="mezzanine">Mezzanine</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Connect the ethernet cable to left port (the right port is disconnected) of ethernet #243 (located in the office to the right when you walk in) and connect the other end to “Primary” on the Decoder box.</li>
  <li>Plug in power for the TV, and plug the DC-Adapter into an outlet and connect it to the Decoder box.</li>
  <li>Run Component-outs from the Decoder to Component-ins on back of TV.</li>
  <li>Turn on TV and set to Component source.</li>
  <li>Run HDMI-out from the Decoder to HDMI-in on back of TV using the third HDMI cable.</li>
  <li>The following must be done quickly using the decoder remote:
    <ul>
      <li>select 1080i-out on Decoder</li>
      <li>switch TV source to HDMI</li>
      <li>hit accept/confirm on Decoder remote</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
