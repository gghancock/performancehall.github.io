        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

        Setting Up a Board Feed for a Videographer
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>If a group decides they would like a video recording of their event and has hired someone to do so, they may ask for an audio feed from the board. This videographer will probably be doing post production and wants direct raw mic feeds as opposed to using the distance mic on his camera.</p>

<p>The method for setting up a feed mirroring the board output would be similar to sending audio to a monitor, except that rather than sending the audio to the patchbay, you will be sending it directly to the video camera.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>First, run an XLR cord from one of the auxiliary outputs on the back of the board to the videographer. You may have to unplug one of the eight auxiliary outputs; remember to plug them back in after the event.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make sure the cord stays behind the chairs in the house and is taped down whenever it has to cross an aisle or walkway; if crossing an aisle, tape the XLR at the bottom of the steps where no one is likely to trip on it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If running a feed to the lower level, use very long cables and daisy chain two or more together;</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Run them from the mixer ➝ straight out to the wall ➝ down the wall to the lower level ➝ back in to where the video is positioned.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Never run cable across a walkway and make sure they don’t either.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once the connection has been made, you will want to send the videographer a test signal.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Select the aux you will be using (i.e. Aux #8), then use the mouse to click on System, then find the test signals sending a 100 Hz, 1000 Hz, 10000 Hz, White Noise, or Pink Noise.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Increase the level of sound until the videographer confirms he/she is receiving signal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Once you have confirmed that the camera is receiving signal, ask the videographer what kind of mix he/she would like.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Say the videographer wants the house mix; you would need to send all of the audio at the same level as it is coming out of the mains, so you would select all of the channels that will potentially be going live during the event and send them at unity, postfade, to Aux #8, and then raise Aux #8 to unity as well, or to whatever level the videographer decides is best.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do not adjust the aux level during the show, as it will make everything suddenly sound louder or softer mid-recording.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If the videographer asks for only vocal mics or instrument mics, select the correct channels and send them to the correct aux.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In some cases the videographer may choose to do his/her own post-production sound editing, and may want a specific prefade mix. In this case, ask what they are looking for, and adjust accordingly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Remember that sending a channel prefade means the aux will receive signal when the channel fades out, but not when the channel is muted.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
