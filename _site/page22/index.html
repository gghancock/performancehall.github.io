        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

    make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who visits

        Stagehand Duties
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.</li>
  <li>Assistance with costume changes</li>
</ul>

<p>Other duties include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Helping other crew members with their set-ups.
Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).</li>
  <li>Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.</em></p>

<p>###Before the Show</p>

<ul>
  <li>Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.</li>
  <li>Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.</li>
  <li>Get a program and take notes.</li>
  <li>Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.</li>
  <li>Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.</li>
</ul>

<p>###During the Show</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls.</li>
  <li>Don’t pay attention to your phone!</li>
  <li>As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.</li>
  <li>During your scene changes:
    <ul>
      <li>Move quickly and with purpose.</li>
      <li>Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>###After the Show</p>

<ul>
  <li>Help others strike and clean.</li>
  <li>Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.</li>
  <li>Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.</li>
  <li>Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we’re not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.</li>
  <li>Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.</li>
  <li>Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.</li>
  <li>Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.</li>
</ul>
