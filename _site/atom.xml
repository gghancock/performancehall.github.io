&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-gear&quot;&gt;The Gear&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This recording primer will concern itself with the various recording rigs that are used at the Logan Center for the Performing Arts. The most elaborate system is the Pro Tools HD rig in 243.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tascam DR-40 Hand-Held Recorder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank4.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is simplest and most “set-and-forget” of all the recording systems we have at the Logan Center. All you need to do is make sure there is a blank CF card loaded into the drive (right side), press record twice and you’re good to go. The built-in mics do the rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TascamLeft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;TascamRight&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you want to use the DR-40 to capture an external feed from a console:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “Line” under the the “Ext In” switch on the side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press “Rec Mode” on the front below the display.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to source. Press “Enter/Mark”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “EXT IN 1/2”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a few caveats to using the DR-40: It’s important to make sure that you are recording in the right file format. You will mostly be using the DR-40 as an archival recorder so for this purpose mp3s are ok as long as they are  above 128k. When you record-enable the DR-40, the display will show what file format is being created. It should be an mp3 of 128k or greater. 320k is best. If it’s less than 128k, audio will still be recorded but the volume will be a bit lower and the sound quality will be greatly diminished, especially at 2k and above (sibilant esses, swirly high-hats, etc.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to change the file format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press stop to make sure the machine is out of record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the “menu” button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The first item is “REC SETTING”. Press “Enter/Mark”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First item on the sub-menu is “FORMAT”. Press “Enter/Mark” again. Press + or - until you have selected  mp3 of 128k or greater.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another concern when using the DR-40 is that everything gets recorded to the internal SD card; it will stop recording when the card is full. When you record-enable, the display will show the amount of time remaining on the card. Ensure that the remaining time is longer than your run-of-show. If it is not, you may need to format (erase) the SD card. Hopefully, the previous engineer should have dumped his or her files.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To reformat/erase the SD card:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press stop to make sure the machine is out of record.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the “menu” button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to “OTHERS”. Press “Enter/Mark”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to “SYSTEM”. Press “Enter/Mark”.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to “QUICK FORMAT”. Press “Enter/Mark” .&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card. Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out). Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows: Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, send the file to erinbrenner@uchicago.edu. Go to the website WeTransfer.com -&amp;gt; upload the recording to the site -&amp;gt; enter Erin’s email address -&amp;gt; enter your email address -&amp;gt; press Send. Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done! [On a lot of the other guides Erin has been encouraging me to remove her name so the guides will have longevity, but for this case I’m not sure what the alternative would be.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you remember nothing else from this primer, remember recording guy rule number one: &lt;strong&gt;check playback&lt;/strong&gt;. Always &lt;strong&gt;check playback&lt;/strong&gt;. Before the show, record a little bit of the soundcheck, plug your headphones into the left side of the DR-40 hit rewind and listen. &lt;strong&gt;CHECK PLAYBACK!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AudioFire Portable Recording Rig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an eight channel laptop-based Pro Tools Rig that you will be checking out from the nice folks at  the Logan Media Center.
Your pack will consist of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;2U rack with an AudioFire Pre8 FireWire recording interface and headphone amp (which you probably won’t use..&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ILOK USB dongle (for ProTools to start up)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Thunderbolt to FW800 adapter dongle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FW 400 to 800 cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank5.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AudioFire&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank6.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP: * - Buy your own headphones. Closed-back are best because they dampen the noise of the room. The fancy ones in the PH are not closed-back. They are useless. Also, most of the ones you buy from Best Buy do not deliver a flat response, they tend to hype up the bass (especially Beats by Dre). The cage has some decent ones. Better yet, buy a pair of Sony MDR 7506 or Sennheiser HD280. The cost is around 75-100$. These are indispensable sound tools. If you don’t have the budget, borrow some horrible cans from someone. Even earbuds will be better than open-backs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need to do to get this contraption working:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug in ilok USB dongle.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect AudioFire interface to laptop via Firewire 400-800 cable and Thunderbolt adapter.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Don’t connect headphone amp. You won’t need it. Connect your headphones directly to the headphone out on the AudioFire interface.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Power on the interface and the Mac Pro.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Launch Pro Tools app. There should be an alias for it in the dock at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank7.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the app is loaded, go to the “Setup” pull-down menu at the top and choose “Playback Engine”. A window will appear showing options for various settings such as “H/W Buffer” and “cache.” At the top of this window there should be another menu also labelled “Playback Engine”. Go to this menu and choose “AudioFire Pre8”. Do not select Pro Tools Aggregate I/O. This menu tells Pro Tools which hardware is routing audio in and out of the machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank8.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If “AudioFire Pre8” , “HDX” or the interface in question is not available in the “Playback Engine” pull-down menu, find and launch an OSX Utility called “Audio/MIDI Setup. This software tells Mac OS which audio hardware is connected and present. You will see a variety of choices. One of them should be the interface hardware. Make sure it is selected as the input / output device and the little microphone and speaker icons are visible next to it. Repeat step 5.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank9.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now go to the “Setup” menu again and choose I/O, This is where you set up and assign in and out pathways for your hardware and bus them to corresponding channels in Pro Tools. At the top of the box you should see the AudioFire interface (or the two HD Pres in the case of the HD rig and not the laptop interface from the cage.) There should be a channel grid corresponding to the ins or outs of the hardware. If there is no grid, go to “New Path” create 8 new inputs. Click the”Outputs” tab and create one stereo out. We know that the Audiofire 8Pre is an 8-in 2-out hardware interface. We are creating 8 paths for input and 2 paths for output (the stereo L/R for monitoring via speakers or headphones. If you were using the HD rig you would be able to create some variation of 16 mic pre inputs  and 32 line level inputs plus as outputs.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to the “File” menu in Pro Tools and select “Create New”. Name your session, make sure file type “wav”, sample rate “48k”, bit depth “24-bit”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to “Track” pull down menu and select “create new”. Make 8 new tracks. This is the most that you can record at one time with this interface. Label all the tracks with the corresponding input or mic name in the text box below the fader.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now it’s time to run lines. You may be taking all direct outs from the FOH guys desk (make sure you have plenty of TRS to XLR-M adapters, unless he has a large format console with xlr direct outs). You may be running all your own mics to capture a totally acoustic performance. Most times it will be a combination of both. We can spend many many pages talking about micing theory, but for this purpose let’s assume that there is a small ensemble of musicians, say a jazz trio of piano, upright bass, and a drum kit in a small room. In a lot of situations like this live engineer will probably only be micing the kick drum, taking a DI from the bass, a pair of condensers on the piano (PNO LO and PNO HI) and maybe a talk mic. He figures he doesn’t need overheads for the drums; cymbals are loud and the room is small.  But here’s what your input list might look like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kick (direct out from FOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OH Ride (home-run to your interface)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OH Hat (home-run to your interface)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bass DI (direct out from FOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PNO Lo  (direct out from FOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PNO Hi  (direct out from FOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Talk Mic  (direct out from FOH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Room (home run to your interface)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP:* - When micing a grand piano with two mics, it is best to think of  the mics as “piano low” and “piano high” instead of “piano left” and “piano right”. You are capturing the bass side (musician’s left hand) and the treble side (musician’s right hand) of the strings on the soundboard. You will want to pan them left and right, but not all the way (there is some overlap, especially if it’s a solo performance at full-stick with large diaphragm condensers. Position the mic capsules facing the fall board halfway between the treble bridge and the dampers. Closer placement to the keyboard/action/pin block will produce more attack and further away will produce more resonance. This is a decision the engineer can make based on the player and the style of music. Put your headphones on and pan until you have a pleasing but not extreme stereo image.  9 and 3 (o’clock on a rotary pan knob) or 10 and 2 is a good place to start. If you are taking a stereo DI from an active electronic keyboard such as a Nord Stage or Yamaha Motif, pan hard left and hard right and forget about it. All panning is mapped within the software inside the instrument.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank10.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no hard rules, but in this situation you’ve covered all the instruments well. And you have also have lines coming from two sources that might seem like an afterthought: the talk mic and the audience (room.) Just because jazz is frequently instrumental doesn’t mean that the performers don’t talk to the crowd. They always do and you need to capture that and you also need to capture audience reaction. That is what your room/crowd mic is all about. Ideally you should have a minimum of two condensers or shotguns focused into the crowd. In this situation you only have an 8 channel interface so one is better than none. You can even swap one of the drum overheads out for stereo room mics. The great thing about ambient mics is that they pick up a lot of the “air” in the performance. This is the blended ambience of the ensemble playing together and can make the sound a little wetter. Sometimes direct or close sounds can be a little dull and lifeless all by themselves. Once you have set all that up, re-save and start getting levels. I like to aim for peaks at -3 in pro tools, but it’s generally very forgiving about overs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pro Tools HD Rig&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the HD rig in 243 may seem intimidating, everything about the graphical interface is the same as Media Center’s portable recording rig. It only seems more daunting because of all the rack gear in the recording booth of 243, but all of the software is the same. The gear that you see in the rack performs very basic functions. There are two HD Pres in the rack providing a total of 16 mic inputs. (some are broken.) In addition to this there are an additional 32 channels of analog line-level input provided by the two HD i/o units above the HD pres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about session setup is exactly the same except steps 1-2 involve patching mic lines from the fanout in 243 (see pic) and in steps 3-8, you are looking for the HDX and HD I/O interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank11.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the stage is wired up, the patchbay in the amp room is where all your mic lines get assigned to the recording booth inputs and all signal-splitting occurs for anything that is being fed simultaneously to the FOH SC48 in the Performance Hall. The cross-patch is where there is a lot of potential for mistakes. This is because what is going to FOH from the stage is not always exactly the same as what is going to the recording booth. Recording engineers often add crowd mics, kick in, snare bottom, ambient mics and anything else that might not be critical to the house, but will add very noticeable elements to a playback mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank12.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are building your crosspatch, remember to split anything that is going to FOH and the record booth simultaneously via the transformer isolated splitter in the  patch bay. Usually the direct side will go to to the Venue inputs and the iso side will go to the record booth. Any inputs requiring phantom power (+48V) that are split in this manner will be powered by the SC48 at FOH (condensers, active DIs etc.). Anything that requires phantom but is not getting split will be powered by the pres in the HDrack in the recording booth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank13.jpg&quot; height=&quot;400px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CAUTION:* - Be careful to never apply phantom power to a ribbon mic. You might blow up the ribbon. Some of today’s newer ribbon mics are designed to withstand this mistake, (especially the Shure KSM line), but it’s still a bad move. You don’t want to be the rookie A2 that blew up the veteran engineer’s Coles 4038, and it can happen without you even knowing it. A ribbon mic often will still function after phantom has been applied; that alone doesn’t always cause the problem. It’s the transient generated when a microphone is hot-plugged into an input with active phantom power that can sometimes damage the microphone and possibly the preamp circuit of the input. This can very easily occur at the patchbay, in that moment upon patch cable insertion when pin one (Ground +48V) goes down the wrong leg of an XLR. Bammo.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every time you fire up the rig, turn on Big Ben first, make sure he is at 48k. Higher resolutions will work also, but not recommended.  Then fire up the HD hardware and then the Mac Pro. Always make sure the hardware is set to “HDX” and not “Pro Tools Aggregate I/O” both in “Playback Engine” as well as “Audio/Midi setup.” After you have your session loaded, make sure Big Ben is at 48k again and all hardware is in sync.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank14.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;AudioLife&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP: * 24bit / 48k bitrate and resolution is recommended because it’s more or less the industry standard. If you do a blind test, you will not notice an audible difference between 48k and anything higher than that. Even if you placebo your brain into thinking that you do hear a difference, it won’t be worth the massive extra hard drive space that a 92k session eats up.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are having a word clock mismatch you will not hear it in Pro Tools while you are recording because you are monitoring on the input side. All you can do is &lt;strong&gt;remember recording engineer rule #1: check playback. check playback, check playback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you are re-starting a session on the show day that you created on a rehearsal day, after you make sure that your hardware set-up is clocking right and HDX is your playback engine, &lt;strong&gt;roll tape while the musicians are tuning up and then press stop, rewind and check playback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t assume everything is locked and fine just because everything was working on rehearsal day when you created the session. Who knows what was happening on the rig between rehearsal and show? &lt;strong&gt;Roll tape and check playback.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anything can cause the hardware to unlock between rehearsal day and show day. Some may argue this point, but I have had it happen from a different hardware interface (MBOX etc) being connected via usb or something as dumb as spotify or itunes software update or other playback software being installed. Audio/Midi Setup sees a different device or software and presto: the next time you start your session, Pro Tools isn’t clocking right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank15.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;NewTracks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-in-pro-tools&quot;&gt;Working in Pro Tools&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank16.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank17.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pro Tools is an elegant interface for grouping similar tracks together, sending/returning tracks to/from virtual effects, inserting dynamic processing, building a mix and the like. These are all tasks that should be taken care of at the mix stage. You should not have to worry about FX and dynamics. However you might want to print a stereo mix (2-mix) of the recording in real time for reference purposes. This is a very simple task. Go to “Track” menu and select “New” , the same as you would for all new tracks. Except this time, create a single stereo track. Label the track “Stereo Mix” or “2-Mix” in the text box below the fader. Place it at the very end of the mix window by dragging and dropping. Press “M” on the channel strip to mute the output. Go to the “In” pull-down menu on the strip and select any unused stereo bus as the input. Now go to all the tracks and select the same bus send on each channel to route all the input tracks to that stereo channel. Make sure each bus send is at unity and that “FMP” is selected. This way all your fader moves and panning will be sent to the 2-Mix. A few caveats. Create a rough board mix during the soundcheck or during the first song of the performance. Don’t do any serious mixing after you’ve got a rough mix pulled because if you accidentally hit the spacebar while the band is performing, you’ve just stopped the tape and shot yourself in the foot. In live multi-tracking, there is no “take two.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PRO TIP: * -  In Pro Tools you can hotkey toggle between the mix window and the edit window using “command =”. If you hold down “option” and “shift” while you are assigning channel i/o functions, Pro Tools will automatically copy assignments to any channels that are selected.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank18.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;RealityCheck&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theory-vs-practice-art-vs-practicality-in-the-heat-of-battle&quot;&gt;Theory vs. Practice: “Art” vs. Practicality in the Heat of Battle&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live sound is about preventing signal from sounding bad as quickly as possible in less than ideal conditions;  recording is about taking all the time you need to get things to sound perfect in the studio. Multi-tracking a live event falls somewhere in between. Capturing a face-melting improvisation by a quartet of jazz virtuosos can be a one-of-a-kind experience. Conversely, being tasked with multi-tracking a 10-hour festival of cover bands with 10-minute changeovers might seem like the worst of both worlds. (Why anyone would want to multitrack that is beyond me, but it happens, and you should smile and take the money.) Just remember, your job is to capture the performance and nothing else (not even mixing… for now.) You must  work well with the musicians and the other techs on the gig to make sure that you get all the instruments to tape clean and clear, with minimal bleed and buzz. If you can get along with people and point a mic at the source, then the rest will take care of itself. &lt;strong&gt;This is not art. This is problem solving.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;be-cool-or-go-home&quot;&gt;Be Cool or Go Home&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:right;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank19.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you are working in a state-of-the-art mobile truck, kitted out with a fully transformer-isolated split, a Neotek Elite console, tens of thousands of dollars in boutique condenser microphones and tons of fancy outboard gear, you are still the “other guy on the gig.” The house crew and the touring guys and gals really don’t care about you. The techs are already annoyed that you’re there because the very presence of your gear raises the noise floor of the PA and they don’t want to deal with helping you run your cable, tie-in your power or wait for you to dial in your super-sweet snare tone. You are the last concern of anybody on the stage, no matter who hired you. How do you overcome this hurdle? Don’t make anybody wait. Pay attention. When the FOH/monitor engineer starts tapping through their mic lines, be ready. They will not wait for you. And always, always, always BE NICE OR LEAVE THE GIG. You can be the greatest mix engineer in the world with the worst attitude, or you can be stone deaf (it’s true)  and still be be super helpful. Guess who gets called back, every time? Hint: nobody who runs crew ever talks about how awesome that bari sax mic placement sounded. But they definitely remember which guy or gal acted like a jerk to everyone on the gig and also the one who ran a bunch of cables across the stage quickly/neatly and with a smile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;garbage-in--garbage-out&quot;&gt;Garbage In = Garbage Out&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float: left;&quot; src=&quot;/assets/recording/frank20.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being a capable audio tech is not alchemy. This is a completely learnable trade. You don’t even really need good relative pitch or the ability to keep a beat (yes it helps, but only a little). As you gain confidence, you will realize that even though you have done your job well, the end result can still sound bad. This is not your fault.  The problem usually lies with the people on-stage. Consoles don’t have “suck” knobs that you can turn down (yet). This is where your people-skills will be invaluable to you. After folks realize that you really do care, the guitar player might listen when you politely ask them to turn down, or you might ask a timid vocalist to hold the mic right next to their mouth. In this way, you can help the musicians “suck less”. If you are unwilling to help people create music that you dislike, this is not the job for you. That said, anyone can learn how to be a sound engineer.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the console by hitting the power button that can be found on the back side of the board in the center near the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load your default board file by going to the “FILES” tab, “Load” and then navigating to your preset folder. If you do not have a board preset set up yet, then load a default from someone’s folder, preferably someone whose board preset you are familiar with.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Depending on whose preset you load, the ceiling microphones that we use for recording shows may be soft-patched differently. There are many ways to set up this patch in order to record shows, however I will detail two main ways, the first being the conceptually simple but lower quality method using direct outputs, and the second being the slightly more complicated but higher quality method using matrices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using direct outs
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The easiest and quickest way to get recording setup is to patch the direct outputs of the hanging house mic left and right inputs to the firewire output that goes into the Mac Pro. To do this, select the “PATCHBAY” tab on the SC48 monitor, within this tab, there should be four sub-tabs labeled “INPUTS,” “OUTPUTS,” “DIRECTS” and “INSERTS.” Select the “DIRECTS” sub-tab, and within this sub-tab, select the “PROTOOLS” subtab which can be found among the two other types of Hardware tabs (FOH and STAGE). For all practical purposes, PROTOOLS here refers to the Firewire cable that connects the amc pro to the Venue. Alongside the left edge of the patchbay grid you should see another set of tabs representing the types of channels available for patching based on your selection of the previous tabs. Make sure “CHANNELS” is selected, as opposed to “FX RETURNS.” We use Firewire outputs 1 and 2 as our recording outputs that go into the Mac. Scroll down the patchbay grid until you find your hanging house mic left and right channels, and then patch each one to Firewire 1 and 2 accordingly. Lastly DO NOT FORGET to go back to the INPUTS tab at the top of the SC48 monitor, select each hanging house mic input channel, and turn on and turn up the direct output on each channel. If you forget to do this you will not get anything out of your direct outputs. (Turn the direct out on by clicking the IN graphic and turn it up by turning up the graphic encoder just above this virtual button)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;DO NOT FORGET to gain your hanging house mics appropriately. I find that a gain of about 10 o’clock seems to work well for any type of show. Optimally, you would gain the mics enough to get the incoming signal as close to 0 dB as possible without going over, or clipping. It never hurts to be too quiet, while on the other hand, clipping distortion is irreversible, so it is always better to err on the side of caution and leave your hanging house mics gained less if you think things may get loud later in the show. If you can remember, make an effort to look at the incoming signal to these channels during your show to make sure you are not clipping. Adjust your gains on these channels appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Using Matrices
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This method uses matrices to send not only the hanging house mic feed into the mac but also takes a split of everything being sent out of your main outs and sends that as well. Thus it is a higher quality option for recording as opposed to simply taking the ambient house mic feed through direct outputs. Since we are sending a stereo output to the Mac, we need to set up a stereo matrix pair. Matrices 1-6 are always in use by the board, as they feed the Line arrays, subs booster, and surrounds, so you will use matrices 7 and 8. To stereo pair these matrices, go to the OPTIONS tab, and then to the BUSSES subtab. Within this tab you can stereo pair auxes and matrices. Go into configuration mode (either by hitting the red button labeled “Config” in the upper left center of the board or by double clicking the SHOW label at the bottom of the SC48 monitor), and then hit the EDIT button in the matrix section of the BUSSES subtab. Hit the checkmark above 7 and 8 to stereo pair them. Next, you need to set up these matrices so that they take the correct configuration of inputs and outputs that we want sent to the recording. Go to the OUTPUTS tab and select either one of your matrices. Inside the matrix mixer you will find 12 possible input channels to the matrix, on the right you will see your left-center-right options. We want to send the hanging house mics to the mac through this matrix, as well as the left-center-right outputs of the board. Turn the Left-Right and Center channels in the matrix mixer on and up via the controls beneath the virtual meter on each channel. Left-Right should be stereo paired, denoted by the checkbox beneath even-odd pairs of channels. If not then simply hit the corresponding checkbox. When any two input channels are stereo paired in the matrix mixer turning one on and up will automatically do so for its stereo partner. Once you turn Left-Right and Center on and up, hit the red user assign button in the matrix mixer. This will bring up the user assign tab. Preferably find two unused user assign channels, and from the drop down set them to your hanging house mic left and right input channels respectively. If all the user assign channels are in use, then change two that you don’t need for the current show (note that changing these user assigns will change them for any other matrices using those user assigns, so be sure you don’t need them before you change them). Hit the user assign button again to exit the user assign tab. Go to the first two channels in the matrix mixer, and from the dropdown box just above the virtual meter for each channel navigate to your hanging house mic left and right user assigned channels. Since these two channels constitute a stereo pair, hit the checkbox beneath these channels to link them. This should bring up a panning option, make sure it is set correctly (pan HHL all the way left and HHR all the way right), and then turn on and up the two channels. If you did this correctly your meters for these hanging house mic channels in the matrix mixer should be showing signal if there is any noise in the hall. Theoretically, since you stereo paired the two matrices, everything you just did for this matrix should have been automatically copied over to matrix 8, or vice versa if you started with 8, but just to be sure you should always check to see that everything is correct in both matrices. They should simply be identical copies of each other. Turn up these matrix faders on your board to unity (0 db) and then navigate to the PATCHBAY tab on-screen. We now need to patch these matrices. We want to send them to Firewire outputs 1 and 2 respectively. In the PATCHBAY tab, click the OUTPUTS subtab, and the PROTOOLS subtab within that. Select MATRIXES from the selection of output type tabs on the left edge of the virtual patchbay display. Find Matrix 7 and 8 and patch them to Firewire 1 and 2 respectively. Make sure your matrix 7 and 8 channels are unmuted and turned up.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;NOTE that if you are using this method for recording, it is highly recommended that you MONITOR your recording outputs in order to not only gain your hanging house mics properly (see Using direct outs part (b) above) but also to get a good mix between these ambient signals and the onstage microphone signals being sent to your mains. In general, the ambient recordings should be quieter, placed in the background behind the main outputs. To monitor the mix, take the headphones that should be hanging underneath the desk where you are sitting and plug them into the headphones input on the board (beneath the front lip of the board towards the right side). Hit the AFL button on one of the matrices you are using for the recording, and use the headphones volume encoder on the upper right hand corner of the board to send the recording feed to your headphones and control the volume in your cans respectively. adjust the mix as necessary. Again, it is always better to err on the side of caution and keep your hanging house mic feed on the quiet side if you are unsure about the mix or whether or not it will hold during the actual show. If you get downtime during the show you can always monitor the mix and adjust accordingly.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up the Mac Pro:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the monitor display to the Mac Pro&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on your empty desktop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “Go” in from the options tab at the top of the display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select “Applications”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open “Microwave”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up your session:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the Sample Rate to 44100&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the bit depth to 24 bit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the channels to stereo if showing mono&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Create”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name your session according to the naming protocol below (don’t include the .mp3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the arrow next to the file name to drop down the filing menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the file under “Documents” -&amp;gt; “PH_Recordings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing the recording during rehearsal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the record button to enable recording (large red circle) while making noise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the same record button to stop recording&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you see a very slight waveform, it means your recording is working, but you want more signal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain the hanging house mics until you see a better waveform. Congrats! You’ve got a recording going.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drag the timing bar back to the beginning of your recording; it will allow you to record over your test
Record the show: Press Record both before and after the show&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalize, Gain, Normalize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the drop down menu at the top of the screen choose “Effects” then “Normalize”; allow it to process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, also under “Effects”, choose “Multiband Compressor” and press “Apply” on the pop up window&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normalize again by repeating step 1: “Effects” and “Normalize”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “File” -&amp;gt; “Export”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that the Output File Format is MPEG 2 Audio Layer III (.mp3) and press “OK”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name the file the same way you named the session (according to the naming convention below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the arrow next to the file name to drop down the filing menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the file under “Documents” -&amp;gt; “PH_Recordings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Send the file to erinbrenner@uchicago.edu:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Safari (using the same method you used to open Microwave or from the dock below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording -&amp;gt; enter Erin’s email address -&amp;gt; enter your email address -&amp;gt; press Send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naming Convention: Year.Month.Date_Show_Engineer.mp3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example&lt;/em&gt;:    14.8.31_ThirdCoastPercussion_Remy.mp3&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Example&lt;/em&gt;:    15.2.24_MEME_Jace.mp3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Troubleshooting the Monitor/Page/Hearing Assist Feed&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard Patch&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The monitor/page/hearing assist feed is fed directly from the center hanging house mic in the performance hall. The microphone is plugged into M29 in the center AVP 202 on catwalk 1. In the patchbay this is patched into one of the mic splitter inputs, and one of the corresponding outputs from the mic splitter sends a split of the signal to the ‘Hearing Assist’ patch. The other mic split goes to the Venue at FOH.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Presonus&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The signal from the microphone is sent through the Presonus Studio One Channel Preamp in the top center rack of the amp room. This unit also feeds the hanging house mic +48 volts phantom power, without which it will not work properly. The other settings and parameters on this preamp channel strip are set according to what makes the /monitor page feed sound best, so please do not touch any of these other controls. The only thing you should ever have to touch on this unit is the 48 volts button, which often times gets turned off by accident.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crestron Control Unit and DSP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The signal from the preamp is sent to a Crestron control unit and some DSPs. The Crestron Control Unit can be found towards the bottom of the center rack in the amp room and is labeled CU-11. The last step in the troubleshooting process after checking the hard patch and the Presonus unit is to take a look at this control unit and verify that it is working properly. If the MSG and or LNK lights are not on, or it looks like the London DSPs immediately below this unit do not seem to be receiving signal, then you may need to try doing a software or hardware reset in the Crestron Control Unit. If you think you need to do this, notify a supervisor first and get his or her approval to do so. Always try doing a software reset first. This can be done by pressing the inset button on the control unit labeled SW-R. If this does not fix the problem, trying hit the other inset button just to the left of this one labeled HW-R. This will force the unit into a hardware reset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stage Manager Console&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that the monitor feed is routed correctly inside the stage manager console (I need to head back down to Logan to write this out as I can’t remember off the top of my head what the particular steps are for this part)&lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2016-09-16T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/projection-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;video-rack-and-projection-system-user-guide&quot;&gt;Video Rack and Projection System User Guide&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;system-boot&quot;&gt;System Boot&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, make sure the MacPro is on and turn on the Projection System using the AMX controller at FOH (it will take a while for the lamp to warm up). Then, turn on the KUMO video switcher by flipping the KUMO’s power switch on the video rack under the FOH desk. Once the Projection System is live, use the AMX controller to set the Source to DVI 2, press ‘GO LIVE’, and unmute video (top left button).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macpro-control-system&quot;&gt;MacPro Control System&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open Chrome on the MacPro and use the Bookmarks to open the Projector and KUMO controller pages in two separate tabs. The Projector page allows you to turn the lamp on and off and align, size, and focus the projected images. Do not mess with other settings on this page, such as the Title List. The Projector page is usually only used for setup and can be closed once you are done focusing. The KUMO page is where you will route all video sources and destinations, and should be left up throughout the duration of the show. To send a video source to a destination, first select the desired destination, then click on the input source you want to pull from. For example, to send the FOH HDMI feed to the stage patch, click output V37 Stg In to select the destination and then click input FOH HDMI to pull the input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;focusing&quot;&gt;Focusing&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should focus the image as soon as you can, before you start working with content. Wait to focus until all soft goods are set if you’re using the scrim since you will have to work around legs, borders, etc. Similarly, don’t set the masking position until you have focused the image on the projection screen. Remember to keep the center speaker out of the projector’s path. You can use the following website for general focusing: http://www.aaarpinball.com/Miscellaneous/p1080.htm (I use Green Pluses and click the pattern for a fullscreen display).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sizing to the projection screen is simple: set the image to fit perfectly between the top edge of the white projection surface and the bottom edge of the roll. Avoid spillover by scaling the image smaller than the screen and slowly scaling it up to reach the top/bottom edges since it can be hard to notice the image on the black screen or hitting the stage below the screen’s roll. If the event is using the scrim for projection, placement and scale of the projection image depends on the specific needs of the group. Will there be dancers or musicians far upstage that could potentially block the image? Consult with the directors to get an image they are happy with that will be visible from almost all of the seats in the audience (someone sitting in the far left side of the house might not be able to see the left edge of the image if legs are in the way). Finally, make sure that the image is centered relative to masking, legs, or the center of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the screen is scaled and placed properly, focus the image by looking at sharp edges and high contrast areas and sweeping along the zoom tool to find the optimal focus distance. It helps to switch between a focus image, high resolution images with moderate contrast (pictures of faces are good), and text.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;line-arrays-and-surround-sound&quot;&gt;Line Arrays and Surround Sound&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you turn on the Projection System, you also turn on the cinema audio system which includes the line arrays and the surround sound speakers around the hall. On most people’s presets they are controlled as a set of matrices which pick off sound sent to the mains, but you can set them up how you like. The line arrays must be flown in from the ceiling and are usually only used with the projection screen (it is ill-advised to send stage mics through the line arrays as you will have to fight a lot of feedback). The surrounds are set up as a stereo output (we do not have control over individual speakers like a 5.1 or 7.1 system). If you do use the surrounds in conjunction with the main speakers, make sure the surrounds are set to the correct delay time so that the audience doesn’t hear an echo from the two speaker systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;video-rack&quot;&gt;Video Rack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Video Rack is designed to be a black box, with users only having to understand what goes into it and what comes out of it. Normal use of the Video Rack does not require any changes to the individual components housed within, and users should aim to avoid diving into the rack by themselves. Keep in mind that the harder it is to get to a particular component, the less likely it is that you should be trying to get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/video/projection-guide/video-rack-flowchart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Video Rack Flowchart&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;KUMO Router&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The KUMO is a 4out/16in video switching device that we use to manage all of our video routing within the performance hall. The outputs are the Projector, Preview Monitor, Crestron System, and Stage Patch V38. The inputs we use are the MacPro, FOH HDMI, Blu-Ray Player, Crestron System, and Stage Patch V37. The KUMO is controlled completely via the Chrome controller (described above) and the hardware in the rack is simply a hub of connection paths, so you should never have to change any of the connections in the rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decimator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Within the Video Rack is a Decimator DMON-6S multi-viewer. This picks off video signals from each input and maps them to a 6 window multi-view display on the Preview Monitor without any required mapping from the KUMO. It also passes through each signal to the KUMO and stays on at all times. This does not require any attention for regular use as it stays on at all times (powered via power strip at bottom of rack(???)) and will never interrupt input signals to the KUMO. This device is connected to the MacPro via USB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Converters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are several video signal converters within the video rack, most of which are AJA HA-5 HDMI-HD SDI video/audio converters. Since most of our input sources and output destinations send and receive HDMI video signal, these converters surround the KUMO (which uses SDI for fast switching). The AJA converters are connected to the MacPro via USB, while other adapters such as the HDCP decoder for the in-rack Blu-Ray player are not connected. These converters are powered via the power strip located at the bottom of the video rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;USB Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The USB Hub that connects the AJA converters and the DMON-6S to the MacPro is attached to the side of the wall on the back of the video rack. If you find that you cannot communicate with these devices, check the USB connections from this hub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Patch Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two SDI patches connect the stage patch and the KUMO video router: V37 input and V38 output. These connections are made under the FOH desk. In the amp room at the center stack, you can patch video signals to and from the AVPs around the stage to set up confidence monitors, take video feed from laptops on lecterns or backstage, or anything else you might need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projection-booth&quot;&gt;Projection Booth&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The projection booth has more control surfaces for interfacing with the projector. The slide-out laptop can be used to save focus settings for shows that have multiple days of rehearsal or performance. You can also use built in high resolution focus and color spread test images to set your focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My input isn’t showing up on the Preview Monitor!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
First, make certain there are no problems with the input source. If there are no problems with the source itself, there is likely a loose connection at the AJA converter for your input. The AJA converters are located at the back of the video rack and are labeled according to the input or output they serve. On the side of the device are two lights that should be lit while functioning properly: a green light labeled POWER and an amber light labeled SDI LOCK. If either of these are off, check that all cables are plugged in and secure, and unplug and replug them all if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My stage patch isn’t working properly!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Confirm that the video rack V37 input and V38 output (these are both at the bottom of the back of the video rack) are connected to the V37 and V38 patch points under the FOH desk. Next, check the patch in the amp room’s center stack. If you are pulling video from a laptop on stage or backstage check that the AVP patch matches what you pulled from in the amp room. If you are having problems with a confidence monitor, refer to the confidence monitor guide after checking all patches.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I can’t get audio from my video input!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Venue gets audio from the KUMO as a stereo AES(???) feed from the back of the video rack at the bottom. The video source should be set so that audio is sent through the video feed. For example, a MacBook on stage should have proper display settings and the audio settings should send out HDMI rather than speakers or headphones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Projector is on, but it won’t display Program!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the AMX controller at FOH and make sure that ‘Source’ is set to ‘DVI 2’, hit ‘GO LIVE’, and unmute the display. If it still isn’t working, go to the back of the video rack and find the AJA converter labeled ‘Projector’ and check all of the connections and indicator lights. Try unplugging all of the cables and plugging them back in. If it still isn’t working, go into the projection booth and check that the white DVI cable is plugged into (what is the port labeled?). If it still doesn’t work, turn the projection system off, then the KUMO, then the MacPro. Then turn on the MacPro, then the KUMO, then the projection system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;one-confidence-monitor&quot;&gt;One Confidence Monitor&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Decimator&lt;br /&gt;
(1) 50’ SDI cable&lt;br /&gt;
(1) short HDMI cable&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Extension cord&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Power Strip&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Monitor (stored in Janice)&lt;br /&gt;
(1) Monitor Power cable: Edison - IEC cable (usually with the monitor in Janice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOH Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Turn the video rack on and make sure the power strip on the bottom of the video rack is turned on as well. Open the KUMO controller (by opening chrome on the Mac Pro and clicking the KUMO bookmark) and set output ‘V38 Stg Out’ to pull from the input you are using for the monitor. Depending on what the speakers want, this could be a copy of what is displayed on the projection screen or presentation notes for a PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Set the monitor where the speakers want it, place the HDMI or DVI cable, Decimator and power strip under the lip of the stage relative to the monitor, and run the SDI cable from there to the nearest offstage AVP (the cable should run under the lip of the stage, up the side, and through the door to backstage). Run the extension cord in the same direction to pull power for the power strip. Plug in the Decimator and the power cable for the monitor, and connect the SDI cable to the Decimator’s SDI input. Plug one end of the HDMI cable into the Decimator’s HDMI output and the other end into the monitor. Dress cables and keep all of the non-monitor equipment under the lip of the stage and out of sight if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI Out &amp;lt;- SDI In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amp Room Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patch V38 to whichever port you used at the offstage AVP.&lt;/p&gt;

(2) Power Strip&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Monitor (stored in Janice)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Monitor Power cable: Edison - IEC cable (usually with the monitor in Janice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOH Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open the KUMO controller and set output ‘V38 Stg Out’ to pull from the input you are using for the monitor. Depending on what the speakers want, this could be a copy of what is displayed on the projection screen or presentation notes for a PowerPoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Set the monitors where the speakers want them and run the SDI cable from one monitor to the nearest offstage AVP (the cable should run under the lip of the stage, up the side, and through the door to backstage). Run the extension cord in the same direction to pull power for the power strip and set the strip under the lip of the stage. Plug in power for Decimator 1 and the power cable for the monitor, and connect the SDI cable to Decimator 1’s SDI input. Plug the HDMI cable into Decimator 1’s HDMI output and into the monitor. Dress cables and keep all of the non-monitor equipment under the lip of the stage and out of sight if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator 1 Settings: HDMI Out &amp;lt;- SDI In, SDI Out (1) &amp;lt;- SDI In (make loop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run the second extension cord from the first power strip to the second monitor and set up a power strip for the second monitor and Decimator 2. Connect the short SDI cable to Decimator 2’s SDI input and the second short HDMI cable to Decimator 2’s HDMI output. Again, dress cables and keep all non-monitor equipment under the lip of the stage and out of sight if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator 2 Settings: HDMI Out &amp;lt;- SDI In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amp Room Setup&lt;/strong&gt;
Patch V38 to whichever port you used at the offstage AVP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;independent-displays&quot;&gt;Independent Displays&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equipment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Decimator&lt;br /&gt;
(2) 50’ SDI cable&lt;br /&gt;
(1) short SDI cable&lt;br /&gt;
(2) short HDMI cable&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Extension cord&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Power Strip&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Monitor (stored in Janice)&lt;br /&gt;
(2) Monitor Power cable: Edison - IEC cable (usually with the monitor in Janice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FOH Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For two independent displays, we need to temporarily reconfigure the Video Rack. Familiarize yourself with the Video Rack first by reading through the Video Rack and Projection System Guide (I can put a link here when I build the page on the website). We want to hard patch a second stage output to the KUMO directly. (Are all of the outputs in fact used up???) Disconnect the output for the Crestron Video Rack (we need a number for this output, I think it is #3). Using the short SDI cable, connect the now open KUMO output to V39 on the FOH AVP under the desk. Open the KUMO controller and set output ‘V38 Stg Out’ to pull from the input you are using for the first monitor and set output ‘Crestron’ to pull from the input you are using for the second monitor. You can easily switch which monitor displays what in the amp room later, so don’t worry about that for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Set the monitors where the speakers want them and run the SDI cables from the monitors to the nearest offstage AVPs (the cables should run under the lip of the stage, up the side, and through the door to backstage). Run the extension cords along the same respective paths to pull power for the power strips and set the strips under the lip of the stage. Plug in the Decimators and the power cables for the monitors, and connect the SDI cables to the Decimators’ respective SDI inputs and the HDMI cables to the respective Decimators’ HDMI outputs and into the monitors. Dress cables and keep all of the non-monitor equipment under the lip of the stage and out of sight if possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI Out &amp;lt;- SDI In&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Amp Room Setup&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Patch V38 and V39 to whichever ports you used at the offstage AVPs and check that the monitors are displaying the correct images for the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;three-confidence-monitors&quot;&gt;Three Confidence Monitors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Refer to the information under ‘Two Confidence Monitors’ to get the information you need for a three-monitor mixture of doubled displays and independent displays. We cannot support three independent displays for confidence monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1 Introduction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the RF wireless microphone guide. This guide is for either (a) new employees who are looking to learn how a wireless microphone works as well as how to set one up, or (b) any employee trying to troubleshoot a wireless microphone, transmitter, receiver, or all of the above. This guide will explain the basics behind Shure’s ULX series of RF (radio frequency) microphones, how to adjust and find frequencies on both the transmitter and receiver, how to lock and unlock frequency, volume, and power settings on the receiver and transmitter, the different types of wireless microphones we own in the hall, and how to set up and properly use those microphones in a variety of settings. In total we own 10 wireless ULXP4 receivers, each with its own handheld SM58 (or in two cases SM58A) and lavalier microphone. We also own two Countryman Headsets, which can be interchanged with the lavalier microphones as needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/1 trans and receivers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;
Figure 1. The Shure SM58 and lavalier microphones (left and top (transmitters)) and a receiver (bottom)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 Tech: Wireless microphone concepts, stock, transmitters and receivers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmitters and receivers
A wireless microphone consists of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter is oftentimes the microphone itself, or in the case of a lavalier microphone (top of Figure 1)  it is the small black box that the microphone plugs into and is clipped onto to the performer. Therefore oftentimes when you hear the word ‘transmitter’ in the audio world one of the first things that should come to mind is simply a wireless microphone. Our wireless handheld SM58s are an example of microphones that double as transmitters. In this guide I will often use the term ‘transmitter’ to refer simply to a wireless microphone. Figure 1 displays the handheld wireless SM58 microphone (left in the image), a lavalier microphone and transmitter (top of the image), and a receiver for both (bottom of image). The transmitter takes the electrical signal generated from the diaphragm of the microphone and converts it to a light wave of a particular band of radio frequency, denoted by the combination of letters and numbers (group and channel) on the screen of both the transmitter and the corresponding receiver. The group and channel is set by the user. This RF signal is transmitted throughout the space and picked up by antennas connected to the receiver corresponding to the particular transmitter being used. The receiver takes the signal and converts it back into an electrical signal, to be sent to your mixer or elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Performance Hall Stock
As I mentioned in the introduction, we own ten total receivers. Four of these ten are installed in the amp room of the performance hall (labeled W1 - 4 for Wireless 1, Wireless 2, etc…).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/2 w1thru4receivers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;
Figure 2. Image of the first four (1-4) wireless receivers installed in the patchbay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another four are installed in a mobile rack unit that also lives in the back of the amp room (labeled W5 - 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/3 Mobile unit receivers.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;
Figure 3. Image of the next four (5-8) mobile receivers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other two are installed in the mobile rig. Each receiver has its own handheld SM58 and a lavalier microphone and transmitter. This means that if you are working in the hall, you can have a total of eight wireless microphones working simultaneously. These eight can be any combination of lavs and handheld wireless microphones, as long as at the end of the day no more than eight channels are in use at any one time. Therefore if someone managing a show asks how many wireless microphones they could potentially use at once on stage (this is a very common question), you should explain to them that there are eight wireless channels, so any combination of handhelds and lavs can be used as long as the total remains eight or under. If you are using eight lavs, then you cannot be using any handhelds and vice versa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shure Wireless SM87A Microphone
In addition to the eight wireless handheld SM58 microphones that come with each receiver, we also have a wireless SM87A microphone that should always be set to the same group and channel as wireless unit 4. (I thought this was usually set to W1? Most likely it changes a lot but W1 matches the lack of tape on the mic)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/4 w87a.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;
Figure 4. Image of the SM87 wireless microphone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The SM87 is a higher quality vocal dynamic mic with a different polar pattern from the more common SM58. It is better suited for professional vocalists who have extensive experience with microphones. As with any other wireless system, you cannot use both this microphone and wireless microphone 4 or lav 4 at the same time. Remember that the number of receivers is what determines the total possible number of wireless microphones that can be used simultaneously. A receiver can only ever have one corresponding transmitter at a time, even though we own multiple transmitters for each receiver. If you would like to learn more about the features of the SM87A, or of any of the microphones we own, please refer to our microphone user guide which can be found here: (insert link)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Antennas and the mobile receiver unit
In the performance hall, we have two Shure active directional antennas installed in the catwalks directly above the front edge of the stage, positioned to optimize incoming signal from transmitters onstage. There is one directly above the downstage left corner, and one directly above the downstage right corner. These two antennas pick up signal from any of the eight wireless channels (transmitters) whose corresponding receivers live in the amp room. They are supposed to both point toward the center of the stage. If one or both get knocked out of place, this may cause interference or other issues with your microphones. Therefore if you are having trouble with microphones cutting out during sound check, either go onstage and try to check by looking up at the antennas to see whether or not they are aligned as necessary, or go up to the catwalks and check that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/5 Antennas.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;
Figure 5. In house perspective of the locations of the two catwalk antennas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the problems you are having are only with wireless microphones 5 through 8, (the ones whose receivers live in the mobile rack unit in the amp room (Figure 3)), then go into the amp room and find the mobile unit behind the patchbay next to the north facing door of the amp room. Two splits from the antennas in the catwalks come down and connect into the front of this mobile unit, providing the signal for these four channels. These look simply like two thick black cables that connect to the front top two corners of the unit via BNC connector. Check to make sure that both of these are plugged in. Note that you can also plug these in in the back of the unit, and so sometimes you will find them plugged in this way. Also note that due to the particular placement of these antennas in the catwalks combined with the fact that they are active directional as opposed to active omni-directional, you may experience cut outs and interference at front of house, so if you are testing a mic at the sound board and find that it is cutting out, don’t worry; it is probably just the fact that you are standing at front of house. Have someone take the mic and check it in other parts of the house and or on the stage to confirm whether or not this is the case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/6 Antenna Types.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6&quot; /&gt;
Figure 6. Active directional vs. active omni-directional antennas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This mobile unit also gets used in other spaces when more wireless microphones are needed with the mobile rig. When this happens the user has to disconnect these two thick black wires and replace them with the omnidirectional antennas that can be found inside the pullout drawer of the mobile unit itself. In addition to this, the outputs from the four receivers in this unit must also be disconnected from their respective XLR connections that connect them to the patchbay, so that the entire unit can be moved as necessary. These connections are usually just left on the floor behind the mobile unit. Many times people return the unit after using it somewhere else but forget to plug the hall antennas back in as well as these outputs of the receivers to the XLRs that go into the patchbay. If this happens then you will most certainly have problems if you try to use wireless channels 5 through 8 in the hall. If the antennas are disconnected, you should be easily able to discern the two thick black cables unplugged and hanging down from the ceiling in the space between the north door and the patchbay. If the outputs of the receivers are also not plugged in then you should just as easily be able to find the four disconnected XLRs laying on the floor behind the patchbay. They are labeled so that you know which output to plug into which patchbay XLR.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmitter: Frequency adjustment and lock
As I mentioned briefly in the first part of this section, the transmitters and receivers both have screens containing information about battery power, frequency selection, and lock settings, among other things. What we need to worry about is the battery power and sometimes the frequency. The battery power is straightforward and requires no explanation. Before doors for a show are about to open, all wireless microphones being used should have fresh batteries. That means that the battery power indicator should be showing full power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/7 trans screen.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7&quot; /&gt;
Figure 7. Labeled image of a transmitter screen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The frequency that the transmitter and receiver are operating at is denoted by what is called the group and channel on the digital screens on both the transmitter and the receiver. A transmitter is matched to a receiver by its group and channel. The group picks out a wide range of operational frequencies, and the channel picks out a more specific band of around 200 kHz, known as the operating range, within which the particular transmitter and receiver will communicate with each other. Contrary to popular belief, the group and channel do not pick out a particular frequency, but rather this band of frequencies. Auditory information is conveyed via frequency modulation, or FM, something you may know from radio, or TV. This means that the information is transferred by way of a wave of varying frequency, as opposed to a wave of varying amplitude, from which comes amplitude modulation, or AM. The term RF, or radio frequency, comes from the fact that this broadband of frequencies is more generally always contained within the much larger band of radio frequency light. Technology has not yet advanced enough to allow us to create cheap transmitters and receivers that can communicate via light of higher frequencies such as microwave or ultraviolet, therefore virtually all of today’s wireless technology–cell phones, wifi, radio, TV, etc…–communicate information between devices by way of frequency modulated radio wavelength light. (inb4 gravitational wave transmitters thx LIGO)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is Performance Hall policy to change ONLY the group and channel of the transmitters to match that of the receivers. This is because the group and channel of the receivers was determined by a complex process of finding frequency bands that are not being overused in the general Chicago area, so as to prevent interference and optimize the functionality of these devices. It is more likely that someone changed a transmitter to match a different receiver, therefore we prefer if you change the transmitter back to its receiver, rather than changing another receiver. If you pull out a wireless microphone, turn it on, and notice that its group and channel do not match those of its corresponding receiver, then you should change the group and channel of the transmitter (microphone) to match that of the receiver. Note that any microphone and any receiver we own can work together, however for the sake of clarity and organization we have coupled microphones to receivers and labeled both in order to keep things neat and in order. Please help us maintain this by making sure the right transmitters and matched to their properly labeled receivers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the group and channel of a transmitter (this goes for both handhelds and lavs) you must first check to see whether or not the frequency is locked on the transmitter. To do this simply hit the mode button while the microphone is on. If the frequency is locked, the mode and set buttons should have no effect, and so when you hit the mode button you should see a brief ‘Fr L’ message appear indicating the the frequency is locked. In order to unlock the transmitter, hold down the set button while the microphone is on. Turn the transmitter off, then, continuing to hold the set button, turn it back on. You should see a quick ‘Fr UL’ for frequency unlocked. Now that the ‘mode’ and ‘set’ buttons are active, you can use the former to toggle between the group and channel, and the latter to toggle between different groups and different channels. Thus if you needed to change both the group and channel of the transmitter, hit the mode button once to highlight the group, then hit the set button to change groups. Hit the set button until the desired group is showing, then simply hit the mode button again to switch to channel. Use the set button again to get to your desired channel (you can hold it down to sweep through a large number of channels if necessary). Once your desired channel is showing, simply hit the mode button again to go back to the home screen. ALWAYS lock the frequency again after you are done changing it. To do this, simply hold the set button while in the home screen (nothing highlighted. If you hold the set button while in group or channel mode you will simply start sweeping through either groups or channels, so make sure to hit the mode button until you are back at the home screen, with nothing highlighted). Turn off the transmitter while holding the set button. Then, continuing to hold the set button, turn the microphone back on. You should see ‘Fr L’ for Frequency Locked briefly appear on the screen, and the lock icon should again be active.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmitter: Power lock
These ULX series transmitters also have the option to lock power, so that if anyone was using a microphone on stage and accidentally hit the power switch, nothing would happen. It is Hall Policy to use the sleeves we have in each microphone case for this purpose (only applicable for handhelds), however to make this guide comprehensive I will explain here how to power lock the transmitters if it ever became necessary. To do this, turn your microphone on and hold both the set and mode buttons down for four seconds. You should see ‘Po L’ for Power Lock briefly appear on the screen. To unlock the power, simply hold the set and mode buttons again for four seconds. You should see ‘Po UL’ for power unlock briefly appear. Again, it is not our policy to use this feature, but rather the sleeves we own for each microphone (every wireless handheld microphone should have both a sleeve and a stand clip in its case). To be extra cautious you could power lock the transmitter in addition to sleeving it, however you should never neglect to sleeve it and only power lock it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Transmitter: Internal Gain adjustment
Both transmitters and receivers have their own internal gain parameters which we prefer to leave at a particular semi-permanent level. On the transmitter, if you are using a handheld wireless microphone, the internal gain can be found just above the battery compartment in the bottom of the microphone (Right image of Figure 8). Unscrew the bottom capsule like you would do to change the battery and, holding the microphone with its screen facing you, find the small hole drilled just above the battery compartment. Inside this hole you should see some white plastic material carved into which is the shape of an arrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/8 internal gain.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 8&quot; /&gt;
Figure 8. Internal gain parameters for both the handheld and lav pack&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This arrow indicates the internal gain of the microphone. Maximum gain is at about one o’clock. We try to leave ours set at between 11 and 12 o’clock. If you need to change the internal gain for any reason, go into the Performance Hall stock and find the shelving unit labeled ‘Special Screwdrivers.’ There should be a very small, thin screwdriver with an asterisk shaped end that looks like it would fit into the internal gain hole in the microphone. Grab this screwdriver and use it to twist the arrow until it is pointing where you want it to. For consistency’s sake, please try to leave all handheld transmitters at the same internal gain, between 11 and 12 o’clock.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are using a lav pack and microphone, the internal gain can be found along the right edge of the lav pack (left image in Figure 8). It looks like a plastic dial. Use your fingers to twist it clockwise to increase the gain, and counterclockwise to decrease the gain. We typically leave these at maximum gain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receiver: Frequency adjustment (are you worried about including this in a general use guide? I don’t want to encourage people to approach the receivers)
There is only one time when it should become necessary to change the group and channel of a receiver (otherwise you should only be changing that of the transmitter to match the receiver), and that is when it has been generally agreed that a particular frequency band is experiencing interference and or is picking up signal other than that coming from its corresponding transmitter due to increased traffic on that frequency band. If this is the case, then the first step is to find a new frequency band (group and channel) that is relatively unused in your area. The last part of this section details how to do this. This part is dedicated to explaining how to change the group and channel of a receiver once you have found a robust frequency band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/9 receiver.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 9&quot; /&gt;
Figure 9. Labeled image of the receiver display (lock icons not visible)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The receivers, like the transmitters, have a frequency lock. This lock should be active on every receiver in the Performance Hall stock. If it is you should see a little lock icon in the position indicated in Figure 9 (the receiver in the image is unlocked). To unlock the frequency controls on a receiver, hold the ‘set’ button, and turn the jog wheel a quarter turn left, a quarter turn right, and a quarter turn left, then release the set button. If you did it right you should see the frequency lock icon disappear on the receiver’s screen (as imaged above in Figure 9) and you should be free to change the group and channel as necessary. To change the group, hit the mode button twice, or until the ‘Group’ icon is highlighted, then use the jog wheel to get to the group you want. Hit the ‘Set’ button to set the group as such. Hit the ‘Mode’ button one more time to highlight ‘Channel’ and use the jog wheel again to reach the necessary channel. Hit the set button again to set the channel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Receiver: Internal Gain, Frequency and Volume lock
The knob to the right of the jog wheel on the ULX receivers acts as the internal gain for the receiver. These should always be left at maximum, which is at about five o’clock. The receivers as we know have a frequency lock, however they also have a volume or internal gain lock. The procedure for locking either or both of these is the same. On the receiver, first hit the ‘set’ and ‘mode’ buttons simultaneously, then hit the mode button twice. This should highlight your two possible lock icons, for frequency and gain. Use the jog wheel to toggle between frequency lock, power lock, or both, and then hit the ‘set’ button to confirm your choice. Please remember to lock both volume and frequency after successfully changing the group and channel on a wireless receiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finding new frequencies
There are a variety of ways one can go about finding unused frequencies for the ULX receivers. I will only cover the two easiest ways, provided by Shure themselves. The first and most straightforward is Shure’s frequency finder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;https://www.shure.com/americas/support/tools/wireless-frequency-finder
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following the link above will take you to a website that asks for your zipcode and the wireless system series you are looking for frequencies for, which in our case is the ULX-P series. You can ignore the fact that it says (Discontinued) next to this selection; the finder still works. Once you enter this information the website will list the potential available groups, and expanding any of those groups will allow you to see which channels are open.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other, possibly quicker way to do this is to use the receiver itself, which has a built in feature that searches for open groups and channels in the area. Scanning for groups is useful for finding the group with the most open channels. To do this first hit the mode and set buttons simultaneously, then use the jog wheel to scroll until you see the words ‘SCAN GROUP’ appear. Hit the set button to start the scan. The receiver will show the group with the most open channels, as well as the number of open channels (between the battery power and channel icons) in that group, denoted by the words ‘OPEn CH’ directly beneath that number. To scan a group for an open channel, hit the mode button once, or as many times as necessary until you see the words ‘SCAN CHANNEL’ highlighted on the screen. Turn the jog wheel a quarter turn clockwise to start the scan, and hit the set button to set the resulting channel as your new channel. Note that the receiver must be frequency unlocked in order to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3 How to setup and use wireless microphones&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patching wireless microphones in the Performance Hall amp room
Probably one of the most common everyday tasks that must be completed in a regular shift in the Performance Hall is patching one or multiple wireless microphones in the patch bay in order to send the signal that comes from the microphone and receiver up to the Venue (soundboard) at Front of House (FOH). Patching refers to the general idea of taking signal from one source and manually sending it to another source via a cable or wire. Below is an image of part of the patch bay in the amp room:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/10 Patchbay.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 10&quot; /&gt;
Figure 10. Image of part of the patch bay in the Performance Hall amp room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each row of quarter inch inputs is color coded to tell you whether signal is supposed to come FROM or go TO those inputs. For example, the green row labeled ‘Venue Inputs’ are inputs that signal is supposed to be sent TO, while any red rows represent inputs where signal is supposed to come FROM.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to send signal from any of wireless 1 - 4, you must find the red row labeled ‘Wireless’, take a quarter inch to quarter inch cable (either green or red) from the rack of hanging cables on the north wall of the amp room, and plug in one end to your desired Wireless output, and the other end into your desired Venue input (see Figure 10 for visual locations of wireless patches). Thus, if I was using W1 on Venue input 2 I could say that I patched W1 to channel 2 on the Venue. Similarly, when you are patching anything else, the key is to think about where your signal is coming from, and where you want it to go once it is in the patchbay. This will help you find your way around when you are still getting use to the often intimidating amp room. Note that if the Mobile Wireless rack unit with Wireless channels 5 - 8 is plugged in correctly as I described in Section 2 to the patchbay, you can find those inputs a few rows below Wireless patches 1 - 4. They are labeled 5 - 8 with large numbers and patch the same exact way as I just described for 1 - 4.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up and using a handheld wireless microphone
Once you have successfully patched your wireless microphone and confirmed on the Venue that you are getting signal to the right input channel, you should do a sound check with whoever it is will be using the microphone on stage. This can be more difficult then it may sound, so do not be surprised when you end up having to work with someone who talks into the wrong end of the microphone and yells at you because it doesn’t seem to be working. If it seems that your speaker is someone who is not an experienced microphone user, then there are a few things you should warn and or teach them about during soundcheck. The first is simply how to hold and properly use a microphone. The easiest way to do this is to go down on stage with the microphone and show them how to do it yourself. If you yourself are unsure about how to properly hold it, simply refer to the image below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/11 How to hold.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 11&quot; /&gt;
Figure 11. The proper way to use a handheld microphone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main points are pointing it directly at your mouth, and holding it about two inches away in that position. Before you return to your board you should also warn them about the sleeve that you will be placing on the microphone before the show. This consists of explaining to them that the microphone will be on and ready to go when they need it to be, and not to worry when they realize they can’t access any of the buttons on the microphone due to the sleeve. Try to explain to them as best you can that you have total control over the microphone when you are at the board, and that they need not worry about anything related to tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up and using Lavalier (Lav) microphones
Lavalier microphones are some of the most finicky microphones we have in our stock. They are small microphones that clip on to the speaker’s clothing just below the neck to pick up vocal audio for talks, conferences or other more speaker oriented events. You have probably seen them on news reporters or lecturers before. The microphone has a wire that connects to what we call the lav pack (the transmitter). This lav pack has a belt clip to clip on to belts or other more sturdy items of clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned earlier, every wireless receiver has both a handheld and a lavalier microphone corresponding to it, however you can only ever use one or the other at a time. The lav microphones are very sensitive, and so set up and placement plays an absolutely critical role in how well they will serve their purpose during your show. You or another tech or someone from our staff should always be the ones outfitting speakers or performers with their lav mics. Before placing the lav on the speaker, test it yourself by plugging the microphone into the transmitter and flipping the switch on the top of the transmitter to turn it on. After you have confirmed that it is working, find the person who is supposed to use the lav during the show and do your best to explain to them as clearly and concisely as possible that lav mics are very sensitive to sudden movements and in general will pick up any and all noise around them. Make sure they know not to touch the lav after you place it. If you are working with a performer who is going to be doing anything other than standing absolutely still or sitting down for the duration of their time on stage, then you should strongly suggest that they use a Countryman headset instead of the lav (see the next part of this section).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When placing the lav you should assume the worst about the person you are outfitting. That is to say, you should assume that they are going to forget everything you just told them about how sensitive the mic is to movement, and that they are probably going to walk around, move and or jerk their head, and even make sudden movements with their body. Bearing these things in mind, clip the microphone onto clothing preferably no more than a few inches from their neck, in a place that seems most stable when it comes to movement. In other words, try not to clip the lav to any loose clothing. In fact, if you are testing a mic on a performer whose event is not within the next few hours you ought to tell them that any loose clothing around the neck or chest, like scarves or loose jackets, should be avoided as much as possible. Even the smallest touch will be heard as a loud boom in the hall during the performance. Refer to the figure below for an example of proper lav mic placement:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/12 Lav place.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 12&quot; /&gt;
Figure 12. Example of proper lavalier microphone placement&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This image is a fairly good representation of proper lav placement, however there is one major problem with it. It looks as though the seam of the shirt that the lav is clipped onto is going to rub against the side and top of the microphone. This is definitely something you should try and avoid. The microphone should always be pointing toward the mouth of the speaker, however it should not be obstructed by clothing like this, especially if that clothing looks as if it may touch or bump into the microphone. If the microphone in the image above was clipped slightly lower on the shirt, this problem might be solved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for clipping the lav pack or transmitter, try to find a belt or some sturdier article of clothing on the backside of the person to clip it onto. Sometimes if you are working with someone wearing a dress and a bra, clipping it onto the bra clip on their back can work well.The lav pack simply needs to be hidden as best as possible in a place that is not uncomfortable for the speaker. Pockets work fine for this purpose assuming there is virtually no chance of the pack falling out during the performance, HOWEVER, make sure to warn the person that they cannot place the lav pack too near a cell phone or other wireless device due to interference effects. Too near means in the same pocket as. You should also place the lav pack based on how it will best hide the wire coming from the microphone. If you need to tell the person that they need to feed the wire through certain articles of clothing, do not be afraid to do so. Kindly suggest to them that it will help their aesthetic if they don’t have a distracting wire dangling around in front of them during their performance. This usually convinces them to do something about the cable. Before the show begins and if you have time, have your stage manager check to make sure the pack is turned on and the lav is still placed properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, if you are using many lavs at once on stage, kindly tell the performers to try and remain as far apart as they can, as we have found that putting many operating lavs into a small area causes interference effects in some of the mics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up and using a Countryman headset
A countryman headset is a high quality and discreet microphone that is placed by way of a thin headset next to the mouth of the user. It is usually of nude color, and is designed for events which require a very clean and professional appearance while maintaining high fidelity audio signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/RF Guide Pics/13 Countryman.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 13&quot; /&gt;
Figure 13. A Countryman Headset&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We own two of these Countryman in our stock. They are used by replacing a lav microphone with the headset. It plugs into a lav pack in the same way that a typical lav does. The headset ear fittings rest over the ears of the user. The headset in the image is rightside up. It can be adjusted for the size of the head by gently pushing or pulling either of the extended ear fittings. The microphone should be placed preferably about an inch away from the corner of the mouth of the user. It should NOT be touching the check but rather a few centimeters away and can be adjusted to fulfill these requirements. The same guide lines that apply to lavs also apply to these, in terms of keeping the mic away from anything that could bump or rub into it (ie: the face of the user).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though these microphones are much higher quality than the lavs, they are not without their limits either. There are a few critical things that come into play and that you should be aware of when using these mics. Firstly, they are just about as bad at dealing with bumps or sudden movement as any other mic is. It is their placement on the user that allows them to function better during situations in which the performer is moving around, thus it is critical that they are placed properly. Again, these mics should be placed by employees only, NOT the person who is going to be using them. That being said, make sure to tell the performer very clearly to refrain as best they can from adjusting the mic after you have placed it. Adjust them according to the head they are being placed on and then gently place the ear fittings over the person’s ears. Make sure the ear fittings are snug around the ears of the user, but not uncomfortable. If you are dealing with someone who has long hair, kindly suggest to them that they should pull their hair back if they do not want any annoying interference with the microphone. In addition to this be sure to caution strongly against the wearing of scarves and large/loose earrings and other jewelry that might interfere with the microphone. Once the microphone is placed, do a thorough sound check, having the performer walk around, shake his or her head, and do anything that they might think they will do during their performance that involves movement of any kind. This will test how well you have placed the microphone, as well as prepare you for what is to come during the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4 Troubleshooting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My microphone(s) are cutting out on stage or in the house
If one or more of your wireless microphones are cutting out in the house or on stage, the first thing you should do is try to identify which mics are cutting out. If you find that only wireless mics 5 - 8 are having problems, it is most likely an antenna problem; namely, someone probably forget to plug one of the two antennas back into the mobile unit in the patchbay. You should also check to make sure that these four receivers are turned on, as they often get turned off after being used in a different location. If this is not the problem, or if you are also having trouble with wireless mics 1 - 4, first make sure you are not trying to run multiple transmitters on a single receiver. That is to say, make sure you are not trying to use both W1 and LAV1 at the same time, or W87A and W4, to give another example. Once you have confirmed that you only have one transmitter to every receiver being used, go to the receivers themselves and look at the RF indicator (Figure 9). The RF meter displays the strength of signal coming from the transmitter. If you are sure that all antennas are plugged in and working correctly, but your RF meter is only halfway or less lit up, then you are most likely experiencing interference from other sources around Chicago that are using the same group and channel. This could be a strong indication of needing to find a new frequency of transmission for the receiver. If you are in a desperate situation before a show is about to start, and you find that one or more of your receivers has less than maximum signal strength according to the RF indicator, then I would recommend using either of the two methods I outlined in the last section for finding new frequencies fast. Otherwise report the problem to a supervisor so that we can more thoroughly investigate the situation. If you end up changing the frequency, make sure that you also change the frequency of the transmitter to match up, and that you tell a supervisor about the change that you made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, if you are using lavs and getting interference, in addition to the things aforementioned, your speaker may have placed his lav pack near his cellphone on his body, and or if there are many lavs at once placed on stage and very near each other, this may cause interference as well. These are things that you should simply warn performers about before the start of the show. If this is happening during the show, contact your stage manager and tell them to inform the performers as soon as they come off stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am getting a lot of noise and scratching on my lav channels
This is almost certainly due to poor placement of the lav on loose clothing, or its proximity to loose clothing combined with movement by the performer or speaker. This is why making sure that the performers are aware of the sensitivity of the mic to things like this is very important to get across before the show. A lot of times performers will be very reluctant to change their state of dress before a show, and you should only kindly suggest to them the option, however it is important to warn performers before the day of the show if possible so they can plan their dress accordingly to avoid problems like this. it  is also not uncommon for performers to mess with the placement of the lav before the show, in which case having your stage manager go and make sure all of the lavs in use are placed correctly before they are supposed to come on stage cannot hurt you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you find yourself in the middle of show getting problems like this, the best you can do is to ramp up the high pass filter on whichever lav channels you are having problems with as much as you can while detracting as little as possible from the voice of the performer. This will help take care of things bumping into the microphone. In addition to this you can put a high ratio (5 or 6:1) compressor on the channel as well to help take care of the high end of these bumps that doesn’t disappear with the high pass filter. Other than this you can really only hope that the performer hears him or herself and realizes that his or her movements or loose clothing are causing the problem. If there is an intermission, or the performers in question go off stage for a while you can tell your stage manager to go and try to fix the lav to get rid of the noise. This is about the best you can do in this situation.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;East Wall AVP and Crestron Control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lighting, Curtains, and Shades&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guide is for beginner employees looking to touch up or relearn how to patch the mobile rig into the 901 AV system, as well as any employees who are looking to troubleshoot patching or other AV issues in this space. For any details on the mobile rig itself, please refer to the Mobile Rig User Guide. This guide will only explain how to use and troubleshoot the technical systems of the Penthouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-the-mobile-rig&quot;&gt;2. Setting up the Mobile Rig&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Penthouse has a built in AV system, which means you do not need to bring any extra speakers with you unless you are working a live musical concert. Mic’d musicians usually request monitors, and digital musicians may request a subwoofer and or quadraphonic mains. If you are looking for details about how to set up monitors, please refer to the Mobile Rig User Guide. The mobile rig is almost always placed in the northwest corner of the space, near the lighting console. After you open and place the mobile rig, find the wall audio-video plate (AVP) on the North wall. This is the plate you will use both for power and audio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/1 NWall AVP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;
Figure 1: Image of the North wall AVP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, plug in your power to this AVP. Then take the two 50’ XLRs in the back of the rig and cable them from the main left and right XLR outs on the rig to Tie Lines 1 and 2 (TL1 and TL2). In an ideal world, this should be all you have to do in order to get hooked up correctly to the main speakers in 901, and often times it is. However it is not uncommon for problems to arise at this point. Since the patchbay/amp room for the Penthouse system is not a secure room, it is necessary that we understand how to troubleshoot the equipment in case someone decides to go in and switch things around from their typical places.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;patching-and-troubleshooting-hanging-house-mics&quot;&gt;3. Patching and Troubleshooting, Hanging House Mics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patchbay/amp room for the Penthouse is located on the east side of the south wall, behind a door designed to remain camouflaged into the wall. You can find it by looking for the crease that runs up the wall in that area. Open the door by pulling on any of the wood planks sticking out of the wall just to the right of the crease. After passing through this door you will find yourself in a small vestibule area. On your right should be the patchbay and amps. Directly in front of you should be a secured metal door that leads into instrument storage for the Penthouse. If you are ever requested to get the piano out, you will find it in that room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When working in the patchbay/amp room, it is recommended that you prop either or both of the doors into the vestibule, since there are no installed lights in this area. The amp rack may be a little overwhelming at first, however there are really only two main sections that you need to focus on when troubleshooting audio problems. One area is the patchbay (Figure 2) and the other is the EV DC-ONE DSP below it. The other components in the rack consist of amplifiers and additional DSPs for the mains, a hearing assist transmitter (for the assistive listening devices), a Blu-ray Player, a turntable, and a Tascam CD player/SD Recorder, among a few other Crestron related pieces of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The patchbay is the sort of heart of your signal flow. Whenever you plug anything into any of the wall AVPs, this is where that signal shows up for you to then send to some other location. The patch bay consists of the components pictured in Figure 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/2 Patchbay.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;
Figure 2: Image of the 901 Patchbay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If everything is patched correctly, TL1 and TL2 should be patched to AUX DSP IN LEFT and RIGHT as in Figure 3. These latter two inputs go to the built in main speakers. If for some reason you are placed near a different AVP and need to plug into a different pair of tie line inputs, then simply find those tie lines in the patchbay and patch them into the AUX DSP INs as in Figure 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/3 line patch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;
Figure 3: Image of the XLR section of the patchbay with line level inputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the label in the image ’LINE LEVEL ONLY.’ There are three main ways signal can flow through an audio system, and these are at mic level, line level, and speaker level. The different levels refer to the amount of electrical power transferred by each type of signal. Mic level signal is the signal that is generated by a microphone. It consists of very small voltages and in order to be able to be processed and sent to other places it needs to be boosted up to line level, which is the type of signal that comes from stereo playback like that from CDs or ipods. Speaker level is above this and the signal only reaches this point once it passes through an amplifier on its way to a loudspeaker. Speaker level signals can transfer a very large amount of electrical power and can therefore be dangerous to work with. You need a very large signal to drive the large woofers that are found in modern loudspeakers, thus the audio signal is boosted to speaker level from line level using an amplifier in order to be able to have enough power to drive loudspeaker components. If you are plugging a microphone directly into a wall plate, without going through a mixer like the mobile rig (which boosts the signal up to line level via preamps), then you need to plug your mic into one of the MIC inputs on any of the wall plates instead of a tie line, which only takes line level signal. You then need to go into the patchbay, find the quarter inch output corresponding to whichever input you plugged into on the wall, and patch that output into one of the two DSP inputs on the row below, as in Figure 4, labeled ’Mic Level’.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/4 mic patch.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;
Figure 4: TRS section of the patchbay with Mic level inputs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this figure you may notice that Mics 5 and 6 are patched to the Mic Level DSP ins using quarter inch cable. Most people tend to plug microphones into the AVP on the East wall since it is the closest AVP to the stage area (the East wall or teaching wall) which contains mic inputs 5 and 6. Leaving this patching in place simplifies the lives of those people not acquainted with audio equipment and patching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are getting signal out of your mixer (meaning you are seeing signal on your master channels) but are not getting anything out of the mains, the first thing you should do is check to make sure that the tie lines you are plugged into are correctly patched into the AUX DSP LEFT and RIGHT inputs in the patch bay. Once this is done, if you are still not getting signal, move down to the EV DSP just below the patch bay area of the amp rack. Any signal being sent to the mains get processed through this DSP just before it gets sent out to the speakers. It has a crossover, high-pass and low-pass filters, parametric and graphic EQs, and leveling parameters, among other things. You should never have to mess with any of those settings. All you need to worry about is the far right section of the DSP, which lists your six possible outputs from the DSP. The Penthouse only uses four of the six, putting the mains in a bi-amplified configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Outputs 1 and 4 are your low frequency outs, sending the low end of the signal to the woofers of each respective speaker. Outputs 2 and 5 are your high frequency outs, sending the high end of the signal to the tweeters of each respective speaker. These settings are indicated by little green lights on the DSP, with a green light next to ’LO’ lit up on outputs 1 and 4, and one for ’HI’ on outputs 2 and 5, as in Figure 5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/5 EV DSP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;
Figure 5: Image of the Output side of the EV DC-ONE DSP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Notice that each of these outputs has a mute button. If these mute buttons are pushed down, they will be bright red and will prevent signal from coming out of whichever outs are muted. This is the last step of the troubleshooting process. Sometimes you may come into the amp room looking for signs as to why you aren’t getting signal out of your mains. If these little red mutes are lit up then that is probably why. Simply push them to unmute them. If you are still experiencing issues contact a supervisor or an experienced A1, as any further troubleshooting is more advanced and requires more time and resources to complete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging House Mic Feed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You should notice that there are two small microphones hanging down in the center of the room from the ceiling in 901. These microphones are permanently installed and were spec’d for the purpose of ambient room recordings for acoustic events or events in which microphones are unnecessary or unused. These microphones are run directly into the patch bay and come out of ‘CEILING MICS’ 3 and 4 in the mic level area of the patchbay (Figure 4). In order to get the signal coming from these microphones for recording purposes you must first patch these mic outputs to whichever tie lines you would like the signal to be sent to in the house. For example, if I have the mobile rig set up and patched into the North Wall AVP and I wanted to send the hanging house mic feed to my board, I would find two quarter inch to male XLR cables from the rack of cables on the wall to the right of the patchbay, plug the quarter inch ends into ‘CEILING MICS’ outs 3 and 4, and plug the XLR ends into TL 3 and TL4 respectively in the line level area of the patchbay (Figure 3). Tie lines 3 and 4 are the two output tie lines on the North Wall AVP (Figure 1). This way I am effectively sending the signal from the hanging house mics to tie lines 3 and 4. I can now take some XLR and patch tie lines 3 and 4 into whatever inputs on the MixWizard I would like. The last thing to remember is that the hanging house mics are condenser microphones, which means that you need to send phantom power +48 volts to them in order to get any signal whatsoever out of them. After you hit the +48 volts button on whichever input channels you plugged into, hit the pre-fade listen button (PFL) and WITHOUT bringing up your channel fader, slowly gain up your two hanging house mic channels until you start to see a sizable signal. In order to test whether or not you are getting good signal you can clap in the space and see if you get a bump in your metering. Alternatively you can plug headphones into the Headphones output on the MixWizard, hit the pre-fade listen button on your hanging house mic channels which sends any incoming signal on that channel to your headphones, and turn up your headphones volume control in order to listen to the signal you are getting from your mics. Make sure to NEVER turn up your channel faders on your hanging house mic channels, as this will almost certainly cause hazardous feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;east-wall-avp-and-crestron-control&quot;&gt;4. East Wall AVP and Crestron Control&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical lecture in the Penthouse includes a speaker with a powerpoint from a lectern. From section one you know how to set up your mobile rig, however now you need to set up the video system for the powerpoint. The East wall AVP (Figure 6) contains the usual Audio inputs and outputs similar to the North wall AVP, in addition to a video input wall plate. Above this you will also find a Crestron AV source controller (Figure 7), and another plate of buttons used to control the level of the roller shades on all of the windows in the space (Figure 9).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/6 EWall AVP.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6&quot; /&gt;
Figure 6: Image of the East Wall AVP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/7 Crestron Source.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7&quot; /&gt;
Figure 7: Image of the Crestron Source Controller&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the name suggests this Crestron Controller selects and controls the volume of a particular AV input in the Penthouse. The ’SYSTEM OFF’ button will turn off the projector. The row of buttons on the bottom, as well as the ’iPod’ button select your potential audio inputs, if you are working in the space without a mixer. ’MIC 1’ and ’MIC 2’ refer to mic inputs 5 and 6 on the east wall AVP just below this controller. If you plug a microphone directly into one of this inputs, you can control its volume by hitting either the ’MIC 1’ or ’MIC 2’ buttons depending on which input you plugged into, and then using the jog wheel on the right of the Crestron Controller to turn up the volume. Note that this jog wheel is extremely insensitive, and you must turn it many times before you start to get any noticeable volume increase. The ’CD RECORDER’ button sets the audio source to the Tascam CD Player that can be found in the amp room and the other buttons in the second row are your video sources which I will speak to next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to project anything in this space, you first need to fly in the screen and turn on the projector. To do this, you can hit either the ’iPod,’ ’Blu-Ray,’ ’WALL PLATE,’ or ’RACK’ buttons on the Crestron source controller in Figure 5. Hitting any of these buttons will cause the projection screen to fly in and the projector itself to turn on. In most cases you will hit the ’WALL PLATE’ button, since this sets the video source to the wall plate in Figure 4. This video wall plate has four different types of video inputs, the most common of which are DVI and HDMI. Once the screen is flown in and the projector is turned on you should be able to simply plug in the laptop or source of video to the wall plate and Crestron should take care of the rest, recognizing the input and projecting it as you would like. Unfortunately this does not always happen. If you plug in your video source to the wall plate and do not get anything on the screen, first make sure that the ’WALL PLATE’ button is selected on the Crestron Controller. Note that hitting this button sets the volume source for the jog wheel to whatever is being plugged into the wall plate input. In our case this would be your laptop input. Therefore if you are getting projection but your audio is not coming through then make sure the jog wheel is sufficiently turned up enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, go to the amp room and find the pullout drawer at the bottom of the amp rack. Inside you should find a small grey remote which controls the projector. Take this out, make sure the ON/OFF button is set to ON on the bottom left of the remote and hit the input source button in the middle of the remote to make the projector scan through all possible input sources. If this does not help, the next and usually most auspicious troubleshooting technique is trying a new cable. You can also check the computer being used as the video source. When you plug the computer into the wall plate the computer should recognize the projector as if you simply plugged a new monitor into the computer. If it does not pick up the projector, then your problem could be sourced within the computer, in which case you should also find a backup computer (the macbooks from the cage are our go-to for this purpose). The vast majority of the time trying a new cable and or computer will solve your problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do not have any problems and your laptop plugs in and projects properly, then you should not have to do much else; however, keep the projector remote in hand, as the ’SHUTTER’ button comes in handy quite often as a quick and mobile way to mute the projector. You should also always go into the laptop’s system preferences and check to make sure any video settings (such as mirroring, screen resolution, etc…) are set as you would like them to be, as well as turning off sleep settings and notifications so as to avoid potential hiccups during a show. Other than this, you should be set up and ready to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;lighting-curtains-and-shades&quot;&gt;5. Lighting, Curtains, and Shades&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Events in the Penthouse usually request some very simple lighting needs. For this purpose we have a number of pre-focused lights on various parts of the stage area and a Strand Lighting Basic Palette II console for live control of these lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/8 Lighting Console.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 8&quot; /&gt;
Figure 8: Image of the Strand Lighting Basic Palette II Console&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Strand console has control over all of the lights in the Penthouse, including the house and vestibule lights, however in order to control them from the board you first must turn off the presets by choosing the ”OFF” button in either of the wall plates near the main entrance or on the east wall. Before turning the presets off, you’ll want to turn on the board by hitting the small switch on the front, and turning up your house and vestibule faders. Give the board and monitor a few minutes to warm up. You then should have control over the lights in the space using the faders on the left side of the board. Typically you don’t need to write cues in this space, and using the faders as live control is enough. As you will see, the faders have been labeled according to whichever lights they control. To confirm which lights are which, simply turn the faders up and down to observe where the lights are focused. There are lights focused on the most common areas for lecterns, as well as the stage and house areas. Make sure to check all of the faders to make sure they are working correctly and that they control the lights they claim to. If you find that a light seems to have been moved or is out of focus, alert your supervisor. If someone asks if you can provide a spot in an area which does not currently have one, it is okay to say no and explain that the lights in the space are pre-focused and unintelligent, and setting up a new light can only be done during hours set aside for tech.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/901GuidePics/9 Curtain control.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 9&quot; /&gt;
Figure 9: Image of the shade control panel on the East wall just above the AVP&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure 9 displays the shade control panel that can be found just above the AVP on the east wall. All of the windows in the Penthouse are equipped with a electric roller shade which can be flown in to varying heights depending on which buttons you press on this panel. The top and bottom buttons in each set fly the shades all the way out or all the way in, respectively, while the middle three buttons act as preset heights. The second lowest button will fly the shade three quarters of the way in, the middle button will fly it halfway in, and the second from the top button will fly the shade in a quarter of the way down. The first three sets of buttons control the shades for the set of large windows in the Northeast corner, the fourth controls the small window in the Southeast corner, and the fifth controls the window to the 10th floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to these shades, there are heavier, velvet curtains which can be pulled out to completely cover the windows in the North end of the space. These are often pushed out of the way and are bunched up near the lighting table in the Northwest corner. Apart from blocking out natural light on a bright day, these curtains are made of a particular material suited for noise isolation and live acoustic optimization. These curtains must be pulled manually and hang from a rail track in the ceiling. Due to the view from the Penthouse, people usually request that the curtains remain pulled back, and thus they very rarely get used. However the shades are useful for an amplified concert in order to mitigate the natural reverb generated from the walls of the space.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the Mobile Rig User Guide. This guide is for employees of any level of knowledge. Practically however, if you are reading this then you are probably either (a): a new hire who is desperately attempting to get signal to your wireless microphone five minutes before doors, in which case I will immediately refer you to the quick start section of this guide; or (b): a more experienced employee seeking to take advantage of the many nuances and benefits the Mobile Rig has to offer its users. It will cover in detail every piece of hardware in the rig, in addition to the different loudspeakers that tend to accompany it. Please refer to the table of contents above in order to find the specific topic which you are looking to understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quick-start-guide-cafe&quot;&gt;2. Quick Start Guide: Cafe&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-up-the-rig&quot;&gt;1. Powering up the rig&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The mobile rig and everything in it is powered by a single switch on the front top right of the rack. It is labeled ’RACK POWER.’ Before flipping this switch, make sure all of the covers (front, back and top) have been removed and put away, and find the Powercon to Edison cable that should be nicely coiled in the back of the rig. Note that the front and back covers of the rig double as tables, with a single pull out leg inside the cover. Pull this leg out fully and fit the metal hooks on one end of the cover into the fittings on the right side of the mobile rig to form the table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/1 Edison to powercon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 1&quot; /&gt;
Figure 1: An Edison to Powercon Cable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug the Powercon end of this cable into the input labeled POWER at the back of the rig at the very bottom in the in-out (I/O) panel (Figure 2) by plugging it in and twisting it a quarter turn clockwise to lock it in place. Take the Edison end of the cable to the nearest outlet and plug it in. Now flip the power switch on the front of the rig. You should now have power!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/2 IOPanel.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 2&quot; /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;setting-up-and-cabling-speakers-evs&quot;&gt;2. Setting up and cabling speakers (EVs)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are in the cafe, then you will need to set up your own mains. The term mains often refers to the two speakers–Left and Right–that point toward the audience and act as the main source of signal amplification. For this purpose we have our two EV TX1122 loudspeakers and a JBL EON 618s subwoofer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/3 EVs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 3&quot; /&gt;
Figure 3: The EV TX1122 loudspeaker used for our mains with the mobile rig&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/4 sub.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 4&quot; /&gt;
Figure 4: Our JBL EON 618s Subwoofer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the event you are working is simply a lecture or speech, then you do not need to bring the sub, since in theory it ought only to amplify auditory information below the 100 ish Hz range. If your event contains live music with a drummer, dj, or general audio playback, then bringing and setting up the JBL sub would be much preferred. There is an output in the I/O panel of the rig labeled ’SUB’ for this purpose. Part 4 of this section details how to set it up. Assuming the event you are working is a simple lecture or speech however you will need to bring the two EV mains and their speaker stands with you to the Cafe. These two speakers can also be referred to as the PA or public address system. Make sure to set your PA up IN FRONT of the ”stage” if possible. In other words, try to set up the speakers so that the performer and more importantly his or her microphone are behind the imaginary line you could draw between the fronts of the two speakers. This is for the purpose of preventing feedback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you decide on placement for your mains, take your speaker stands and loosen ONLY the bottom section that allows the legs to spread out. Do not touch the top sections, which are pressurized and can cause serious harm to someone who loosens them without a speaker already on the stand. Place the stands and retighten their lower sections. Pick up a speaker and place it on the top of the stand so that the top part of the stand goes inside the hole in the bottom of the speaker. Position the speakers by spinning them as needed. The main goal of speaker placement is relatively simple: even coverage over every point in the house, where the house is the area in which the audience is found. This becomes much more complicated then it may sound, however for our purposes just focus on pointing the speakers such that it seems in general that they cover as much of the audience as possible. In the cafe this can become difficult when the audience begins to overflow into the hallway that separates the kitchen from the general seating area and ’stage,’ however just do your best and don’t be afraid to refocus one of the speakers so that it points more in that direction. Your PA does not have to be set up in a symmetric configuration, though acoustically symmetry is usually preferable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are a real stickler for speaker placement and want to make sure that you have done the best job possible when positioning your speakers, you can look up what is commonly called the beam width, or simply horizontal and vertical coverage of the speakers you are using. The beam width refers to the maximum angle which sound can cover coming out of the speaker. The horizontal coverage of our TX1122s is 90 degrees, while the vertical coverage is 50 degrees. When you place your speaker, stand in front of it and hold your arms out trying to make a rough estimate of the horizontal coverage of the speaker, this will give you a very rough idea of the area of coverage based on how you have placed the speaker. Typically you will not need to worry about the vertical coverage. If you did not touch the top knob on the speaker stands and simply left them as short as they can be then you will be good to go there. One last thing to remember when placing speakers is that in general you do not want any two main speaker paths to be crossing within the space you are working. That is to say that if you drew a line coming out of the front of each speaker and they intersected as some point in the house, then you want to reposition the speakers such that these imaginary lines are not overlapping. Refer to Figure 5 below for a visualization of this idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/5 speak place.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 5&quot; /&gt;
Figure 5: Visualization of proper speaker placement (top) and a top down view of the beam width or horizontal coverage of a speaker (bottom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have properly placed your speakers, find the two 50’ Speakon cables that live in the back of the rig along with the power cable and other various cables. The ends of these cables are blue and gray and look just like the end of the Powercon cable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/6 speakon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 6&quot; /&gt;
Figure 6: Speakon cable, also known as NL2 cable. (Note that this cable should not be confused with that which can be found in the amp room. They are NOT the same and the amp room cables should not leave there)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug these into the Speakon outputs labeled LEFT and RIGHT or PASSIVE OUTS in the I/O panel (Figure 2) right by the power input. The Speakon cables plug in the same way that the Powercon does. Take the other ends of each of the cables and plug each one into its respective speaker. It does not matter which of the two inputs on the back of the speaker you plug into. You are now ready to send signal to the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-signal-to-your-mains&quot;&gt;3. Getting signal to your mains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once your speakers are placed and plugged in, return to the rig and turn your three master faders up to unity, or 0 dB. There is one for Left (L), Center (M), and Right (R) respectively. These faders are found on the bottom right corner of the mixing console. Find the pullout drawer on the front bottom of the rig and take out one or both of the Shure SM58A Wireless Microphones. These microphones should be semi-permanently patched to channels 15 and 16 of the MixWizard and ready to go at all times. Turn on the microphone by flipping its switch. If it is dead you will need to unscrew the bottom cap and put a fresh 9 volt battery in, either from the pullout drawer or the Performance Hall stock.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the microphone is turned on, move your line of sight up from the pullout drawer to the two rack mounted wireless microphone receivers (Section 14 Figure 23). Tap or scratch the dome of the microphone while looking at the receiver; you should see some lights on the left side of the receiver respond to your touch. If you do not see anything and the receivers do not seem to be receiving signal from the microphones, check to see that the combination of numbers and letters on the little screen of the microphone match those on the receiver. If they do not, then you will need to refer to the Shure ULXP4 section (14) of this guide to change the frequencies (please note that if you need to do this, make sure to change the frequency of the microphone and NOT that of the receiver).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you do see the lights on the receiver respond then move up to the mixing console on the top of the rig. The two input channels labeled W1 and W2 respectively can be found just to the left of the master faders. These are your two semi-permanent wireless microphone channels. Find the W1 channel fader, and hit both the mute button (to unmute if the channel is muted) and the circular gray button just above the fader labeled PFL (Pre-fade Listen). This will display the incoming signal from that channel on the meter just above the master faders. You can look at this meter to determine whether or not your channel is getting signal before you turn up your channel fader. Tap your microphone again to see if you are getting signal on the channel; the meter should respond to your touch. If it does, slowly turn up the W1 fader as you talk into the mic. If you hear yourself coming out of the speakers, then you did everything right! Now simply continue talking into the mic and adjust the gain knob at the very top of the input channel strip until your mic is at an agreeable level (optimally the signal on your master meter should be reaching just up to 0 dB, where the lights turn from green to yellow).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you need a second wireless microphone, repeat the process with W2. If you need a wired mic, grab the mic and some XLR from the Performance Hall stock, or alternatively you can check these out from the Logan Media Center, and plug into whatever mic channel you would like on the back of the mixing console. Then repeat the steps above to check your mic (unmute, PFL).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-the-snake-and-setting-up-monitorssubs&quot;&gt;4. Using the Snake and Setting up Monitors/Subs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Audio Snake:&lt;/strong&gt; To make the cabling process from microphones and or monitors on stage to your mixer easier we have provided an audio snake that lives in the back of the mobile rig. An audio snake is simply a thick cable that is made up of many individual XLR and or quarter inch cables.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/7 snake.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 7&quot; /&gt;
Figure 7: Image of an audio snake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitors:&lt;/strong&gt; There are a lot of shows both in the penthouse and the cafe which involve live musicians. If this is the case then you most likely will need to set up monitors, which are loudspeakers that point toward the performers so that they can hear themselves and other members in the band. The two JBL PRX612M loudspeakers which live in instrument storage serve this purpose for the mobile rig.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/8 JBLs.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 8&quot; /&gt;
Figure 8: The JBL PRX612M which we use as a monitor with the mobile rig&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to set one of these up. If you look at the AUX send outputs on the back of the MixWizard (Figure 11) you should notice that there are two cables plugged into AUX 1 and 2 labeled MONS 1 and 2 respectively. These cables go to the DBX 215 units correspondingly labeled MONS 1 and 2 on the front of the rig. These are called graphic equalizers and are simply extra EQs for monitor processing. For details on how to set up a monitor through one of these two units, refer to section 13 of this guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The classic and straightforward way to set one of these up which bypasses the GEQs and uses instead any of AUX three through six requires one XLR male to quarter inch TRS cable and one Edison to IEC power cable. Usually the latter of these two cables lives with the speakers in instrument storage, squished beneath the handle on the side of the speaker. If not, you will have to grab one from the shelving unit backstage. The male XLR to quarter inch TRS cable can be found in Janice. These cables are fairly short, so grab some extra XLR and an extension cord considering how much additional length will be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/9 XLR to quarter.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 9&quot; /&gt;
Figure 9: Male XLR to quarter inch TRS cable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/10 edison to IEC.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 10&quot; /&gt;
Figure 10: Edison to IEC cable&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Place the monitor by getting it as close to the musician as possible without cramping his or her space. The speaker typically sits pointing up toward the musician, but it can be turned on its side, propped up with a roll of gaff tape, or placed on a stage cube depending on the height needed. Plug the IEC into the back of the speaker and the Edison into the nearest outlet or power strip. Turn the internal gain knob on the back of the speaker about half way up to start, make sure the monitor/main EQ button is set to monitor, and the set the input button to line level. Then plug an XLR into the input of the speaker, and cable back to your mixer or snake in a neat fashion (traveling in 90 degree angles and against the walls where possible).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plug the quarter inch TRS end of your cable into AUX 3 on the back of the mixing console, or alternatively any of the other available AUXes if that one is already in use. If you are using the snake then find the quarter inch TRS male head corresponding to whichever input on the snake you plugged your monitor into and plug this end into the AUX. These AUX outputs can be found in the middle of the back of the mixing console, below 11 the mic/line inputs (Figure 11). Return to the monitor and flip the power switch on the back panel on. Now go to your master channel side of the mixing console (the right side), and find your master AUX knobs. If you are having trouble finding any of these things on the mix console please refer to Figure 12. If your monitor is plugged into AUX 3, turn the master AUX 3 knob up to unity (0 dB) and trace your finger directly to the left until you hit the AUX 3 knob corresponding to the channel that your mic is on. This knob will send an amount of the incoming signal proportional to the amount you turn the knob to whatever is plugged into the AUX 3 output on the back of the board, which in this case is our monitor. Before we do this, however, three knobs below this AUX 1 knob you will find a small, gray, square button labeled ’pre/post’ fader. Set this to pre-fader. This means that a split of the signal coming into that channel will be sent to the AUX BEFORE it reaches your fader. Therefore even when your fader is all the way down, signal can still be sent to the monitor, unless the channel is muted, in which case you will not get any signal out of the mains or the monitor from that particular input channel. Now talk into your mic and slowly turn up the AUX 3 knob on your mic’s channel. You should start to hear yourself in the monitor. If you do not, make sure the gain knob on the back of the speaker itself is turned up, check that your cables are properly plugged in, make sure the master aux knob is turned up and make sure your mic channel is unmuted and set to pre-fader. Again for details and locations of particular parameters on the mix console refer to Figure 12.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subs:&lt;/strong&gt; Our EON 618s subwoofer (Figure 4) is also made by JBL and has a back panel very similar to that of the monitors from above. Plug an IEC to Edison into the sub and then into a wall outlet, plug an XLR into the ’SUB’ output on the I/O panel of the mobile rig (Figure 2) and into either of the two inputs on the sub, turn the internal gain knob on the sub up about halfway or so, and flip on the power switch on the back panel. You shouldn’t need to mess with any of the other buttons or parameters on the back panel, unless you need to turn off the LED on the front of the speaker, in which case you can hit the button in the upper righthand corner of the back panel labeled ’Front LED.’ Other than this, the setup is as easy as that. The signal going to the sub comes from the Left/Mono out of the DBX DriveRack PA+, so make sure you have both your left and right channels turned up when playing back stereo audio.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;quick-start-guide-penthouse-901&quot;&gt;3. Quick Start Guide: Penthouse (901)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;powering-up-and-getting-signal-to-the-mains&quot;&gt;1. Powering up and getting signal to the mains&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the penthouse the mobile rig is almost always placed in the northwest corner of the room. Assuming this is the case, we will use the wall AVP on the north wall for power and signal flow. For specifics on powering up the rig refer to part 1 of section 2. Otherwise, plug your power cable into the north wall AVP. The penthouse has two main speakers built into the east wall, therefore you do not need to bring up any speakers with you unless you need monitors. To get signal to the built in mains, take two XLRs (there should be two fifty footers which live in the back of the rig) and plug them into the XLR outputs labeled LEFT and RIGHT on the I/O panel on the back and bottom of the rig (Figure 2). Cable these behind the curtains on the north wall over to the AVP panel where you plugged your power in. Plug the ”LEFT” XLR into TL1 (Tieline 1) and the ”RIGHT” into TL2 (Tieline 2). The patches from there to the mains are usually left untouched, however if you test a mic and find that you are getting signal out of your console and into the wall but not out of the mains, then refer to the Penthouse User Guide, which details the house patching and how to troubleshoot anything that might come up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-mixing-console&quot;&gt;4. The Mixing Console:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mixing console in the mobile rig is an Allen and Heath MixWizard3 16:2. It has 16 mic/line inputs with inserts and direct outs, 2 stereo returns (ST1 and ST2), Left/Right/Center outputs with inserts, an extra AB out which we use for recording, and 6 Auxiliary outputs, typically used for monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/11 Mixwizard back.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 11&quot; /&gt;
Figure 11: A labeled image of the back of the MixWizard Console&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel Strip:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each input channel strip has from top to bottom: a 48 volts phantom power button, a -20 dB pad button, a gain knob, an 80 Hz high pass filter button, a four node semi-parametric EQ, AUX send knobs for AUX sends 1 through 4, a pre/post fader button, AUX send knobs for AUX sends 5 and 6, a pan knob, a mute button, a pre-fade listen button (PFL), and finally the channel fader. The EQ is equipped with high and low shelves at 80 Hz and 12k Hz respectively and high mid and low mid bells (1.8 Q) which together can be swept along the full frequency range (30 Hz to 15k Hz). All of these parameters are basic audio engineering tools which you should have learned about in Audio 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/12 channel strips.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 12&quot; /&gt;
Figure 12: Labeled images of two input strips (left) and the master strip (right), on the MixWizard3&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Channel Strip:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the far right of the console, next to all of the input channels, is the master channel strip. At the top right corner you will see what looks like a XLR input, only with four pins instead of three. This input is actually for a gooseneck light if you are working in a dark space and need to see the board. The light can be found in the pullout drawer of the rig and has a small switch on the top of the bulb encasing which you can use to switch the light on and off. Directly below this light input you will find a quarter inch input for headphones (monitoring), and below this the master knob for Stereo Return 2 with a button labeled ’TO LR’ which sends whatever your return signal is from ST2 to your main mix. If you are wondering how stereo returns work, you can read section 8, which details an effects processor we have routed through ST1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Internal Effects (FX):&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the left of these inputs and parameters (still at the top of the Master Channel Strip) are a set of four additional AUX knobs for AUX 1 through 4. These act as FX sends for the built in effects processor in the MixWizard, which means that if you are using one of these built in effects and want to send it to, say, AUX 1, you would use the AUX 1 knob up at the top of the master channel strip to do this. Do not confuse these AUX knobs with the master AUX knobs farther down the master channel strip. Below these AUX knobs you will see a list of banks, 1-8 and 9-16, below which is a small square button labeled ’bank’ with a red light and a rectangular button labeled ’sel’ for select. These banks correspond to the effects listed at the bottom of the master channel strip on the left of the master channel faders. Use the select button to browse through the effects until you reach the number corresponding to the effect you want. Use the small square button above it to switch to bank 9-16. When you press this button down the red light will come on indicating to you that you are in bank 9-16 rather than 1- 8.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These built in effects are routed through AUXes 5 and 6 (notice that the FX send AUX knobs I was talking about in the last paragraph only include 1-4. Again, Do not confuse these with the general AUX sends which I am referring to now), and the return signal comes through stereo return 1 (ST1) and into your master mix. If you look below your master AUX knobs on down the channel strip and just above your master faders, you will see three small recessed blue buttons with labels next to them. The one on the upper left allows you to switch between ’single FX’ and ’dual FX’ as labeled. When single FX is enabled the processor works as a single effects unit routed to AUX 5. We however typically leave the button in dual FX mode, which causes the effects processor to work as a dual effects unit, routed through AUX 5 and 6. In dual FX mode, when you select an effect in the bank, say number 3, the effect will be routed to AUX 5 and the corresponding effect in bank 9-16, namely 11 in this example will be routed to AUX 6. Make sure you are looking at the ’Dual FX’ list next to the master faders rather than the ’Single FX’ list when in this mode. To apply your chosen effect simply unmute ST1 and set it to unity and slowly turn up your input channel AUX 5 or 6 knobs while checking your mic corresponding to that input channel. You should hear your chosen effect coming through your mains. Note that you DO NOT need to have your master AUX 5 and 6 knobs turned up in order to use the built in effects processor. The master AUX 5 and 6 knobs only need to be used when you are using AUX 5 or 6 for the purpose of say a monitor, or some other general audio send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master Meter:&lt;/strong&gt; Next to your effects banks you will find the master meter, which displays your pre-fade listen (PFL) signal when you have any of the PFL buttons on your input strips pushed down. This is a very useful tool for checking if you are getting signal to your mains before turning up your faders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Headphones Control:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Below your master meter is your master headphones knob, which controls the volume going to your headphones (used for monitoring the mix). Below this knob is a column of small grey buttons corresponding to all of the possible outputs on your board, as you will see labeled. Selecting one or more of these will send the corresponding output signal to your headphones. When none of them are pushed down, the system defaults to the Left Right mix and sends this to your phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master AUX Knobs:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Next to these buttons on their left are the master AUX knobs. When using any of your AUX outputs you must remember to turn the corresponding AUX master knob up, or else you will not get anything out of these outputs. For example, if you are trying to send signal from channel 1 to AUX output 1, first make sure that your output is cabled correctly and the speaker is working. Then turn your master AUX 1 knob up to unity. If the pre/post fade button is set to pre, then without turning up your channel 1 fader you can begin to turn up your AUX 1 knob on channel 1 while checking your mic plugged into channel 1. If your pre/post fade button is set to post, then you must turn up your channel fader (to the mains) first in order to get anything out to your monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AB Out:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Below the master AUX knobs and the headphone send buttons you will find a knob labeled AB out, three small recessed blue buttons, and your three master faders: Left, Right, and M, in addition to the internal FX lists. The AB out is essentially an extra stereo left right output. The small recessed blue button above it selects the input source. When it is set to ’ALT LR OUT’ it picks off the signal coming out of your Left/Right Main output. When it is set to Monitor it picks off whatever signal is being sent to your headphones above. In our rig the AB out is fed to the input of the Tascam CDR 200 for recording purposes, therefore you should not need to change its source from ALT LR OUT. If you were at a gig in which there is a separate engineer running monitors, then you might use the AB out in Monitor mode to send the engineer whatever outputs he might want to be able to hear from your board. For our purposes however it is best to leave this output routed to the Tascam for recording purposes. It could also be used as a videographer feed, however as I am about to explain in the next paragraph we already have the M fader dedicated to this purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mono Out:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The small blue button below the AB out sets the source for the M (Mono) master fader on the far bottom right of the board. If it is set to L+R, then the M fader controls a summed Left Right Mono output, labeled as MONO OUT in the I/O panel at the back bottom of the rig (Figure 2). This is useful for external recording purposes, for example if a videographer arrives at an event and asks you for a feed from your board, you can give him the ’M’ out feed. If the button is set to AUX 6 then this fader acts as a master fader for AUX 6. We leave ours set to L+R.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-rack&quot;&gt;5. The Rack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now move on to the hardware beneath the mixing console. Collectively each unit is screwed into the rack beneath the mix console, which holds them in an organized and easily accessible fashion, hence the name of this section. Starting from top to bottom we have:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Furman PL-PRO C&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two DBX 266xs Compressors/Gates (four channels in total)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lexicon MX200 Effects Processor with 2 input channels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PreSonus Studio Channel Preamp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;TASCAM SS-CDR200 CD Player/SD Recorder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DBX DriveRack PA+ loudspeaker management system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DBX 231s Graphic Equalizer&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two DBX 215 Graphic Equalizers (four channels in total)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;two Shure ULXP4 wireless microphone receivers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;QSC GX7 Power Amplifier&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;metal pullout drawer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

Figure 13: Furman PL-PRO C&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This piece of hardware is simply a power conditioner which controls power sent to all hardware in the mobile rig. The switch on the far right labeled RACK POWER turns the entire rig on and off. The Pl-Pro also has two pullout lights. If you are working in a dark space and need to access any of the rack hardware, pull out these lights and press the knob to their left labeled ’Lamp Dimmer On/Off’ to turn them on. Adjust the dimness of the lights by twisting this knob. The PL-Pro has a voltmeter in the center, a USB power supply and Edison inputs on both the front and back for power to external devices such as laptops or phones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dbx-266xs-compressorgate&quot;&gt;2. DBX 266xs Compressor/Gate&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/14 DBX compressor.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 14&quot; /&gt;
Figure 14: DBX 266xs Compressor/Gate&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DBX 266xs is a dual channel compressor/gate, which works as an inserted effect. Each channel is labeled as COMP 1, 2, 3 or 4, respectively. If you want to place a compressor/gate on a channel, go to the back of the MixWixard console. There should be a number of unplugged quarter inch cables resting in that area. Four of these should have corresponding COMP 1, 2, 3, or 4 labels on the connector piece. Pick the one you want and plug it into the ’insert’ input of the input channel of your choice. The ’insert’ inputs can be found just above the mic/line inputs on the back of the MixWizard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might also hear these inputs referred to as ’sends/returns,’ since these take the signal coming into your input channel, SEND it to wherever the other end of your insert cable goes, in our case one of our DBX compressors, and then the output of the compressor returns the processed signal back along the same cable and back into your input channel. For our particular mixing console, the inserts pick off the signal to send after the high-pass filter and before the EQ on the channel strip. Therefore, with regard to our compressors, when you insert one on a channel you can simply imagine a new set of knobs that control your compressor parameters between the high pass filter button and the channel EQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Going from left to right along the compressor, we first have the gate section of the first channel with threshold and ratio, along with a threshold meter in the upper left corner. We then have the compressor with your threshold knob, an ’Overeasy’ button (which controls the knee of your compressor [pushed down and lit up means a soft knee, pushed out and unlit means a hard knee]), ratio knob, attack knob, an auto attack/release button, release knob, output gain knob, and a bypass button. If you are trying to place a compressor on a stereo channel mix you can hit the small ’stereo couple’ button in between the two compressor channels. You might do this if you have two panned drum overheads, or if you are receiving a poor quality stereo playback recording. Each compressor also has a threshold and gain reduction (GR) meter. As mentioned before, there are four channels in total. Below is a link to the DBX site for this piece of hardware, where you can find documentation and a user manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/15 Lexicon.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 15&quot; /&gt;
Figure 15: Lexicon MX200 Effects Processor&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the built in effects from the MixWizard, the Lexicon offers two more channels of high quality effects. In the same way that the DBX compressors were routed via insert into an input channel, the Lexicon also works as an inserted signal processor, however the return signal takes a slightly different path on its way to the master outs. Instead of coming back along the insert cable, the output is sent to ST1, or Stereo Return 1 on the back of the MixWizard, in the same way that the built in effects are sent through this return on their way to your master mix. Going from left to right the Lexicon has an input gain knob, a mix 1 knob and a mix 2 knob. It then has four columns of listed effects with accompanying lights that indicate which effects are selected. Next to these lists are two sets of controls to select and modify the desired effect(s). These consist of the effect select buttons, a pre delay or time/speed knob, a decay or feedback/depth knob, a variation knob, and tempo and bypass buttons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The labeled knobs vary in their purpose depending on which effect is selected, so a certain amount of trial and error is required when using the Lexicon. The technical manual for this device can be found in the pullout drawer at the bottom of the rig. The MX200 has two channels of effects, therefore in the back of the rig along with the four unplugged compressor cables you will also find two more unplugged quarter inch TRS cables labeled LEX 1 and LEX 2 respectively. To use the device plug one of these into the desired insert channel and make sure ST1 is turned up and unmuted. You can then select your effects using the ”Effects Select” buttons and set up your mix using the mix knobs on the far left of the Lexicon. Refer to the Lexicon Manual to determine how to use the three knobs in each ’Processor’ section of the device to adjust your chosen effect. If you use the ’LEX 1’ cable then you should be using the Mix 1 knob to control the mix volume, likewise with LEX 2 and Mix 2. For more details on how these parameters work please refer again to the manual, the link to which can be found below.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 16: Tascam SS-CDR200 CD Player/SD Recorder&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This part of the rack serves two main purposes: audio playback from a CD or SD card, and recording to an SD card. For specifics on how to set up recording to an SD card from this device or the handheld Tascam, please refer to our Tascam Recording guide. This discussion will be limited to audio playback. For many events you will be requested to provide house music. In most cases jazz is preferred, so we have provided a few jazz CDs in the pullout drawer of the mobile rig to choose from. To play the CD, first hit the Eject button next to the input side of the front of the Tascam. This will eject any CDs that were left inside the disc drive. Once you know the disc drive is empty insert your disc and hit the ’Device’ button directly to the right of the digital screen. This will pull up a list of the possible devices off of which you could play media files. Use the jog wheel (spin to move between selections, push down to select) to select ’CD’ and your disc should be automatically loaded and ready to go. Before playing the disc make sure the outputs of the Tascam are plugged in correctly by going to the back of the MixWizard console and looking at channels 15 and 16, which we use for the CD Player. A lot of times people may replace the CD player on these channels with an eighth inch to dual XLR for the purpose of playback from a phone or laptop. If this is the case then you will need to find the ’CD L OUT’ and ’CD R OUT’ quarter inch cables which should be laying around in the back with the other unplugged effect cables. Plug these into the LINE inputs of channels 15 and 16. Once this is done you can return to the front of the rig and press the play button on the Tascam to play the CD from the beginning. You can use the STOP, 21 PAUSE, and SKIP buttons to stop or pause the track and skip between songs. For details on how to record to an SD Card, please refer to the Tascam recording guide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dbx-driverack-pa-loudspeaker-management-system&quot;&gt;5. DBX DriveRack PA+ Loudspeaker Management System&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/17 driverack.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 17&quot; /&gt;
Figure 17: DBX DriveRack PA+&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The DBX DriveRack PA+ is a very powerful piece of rack-mounted hardware. As the name suggests it manages your PA through the use of automatic system tuning EQs, feedback eliminators, and speaker leveling circuitry. If you look at the back of the DriveRack, you will see Right Left/Mono inputs that are patched from the L/R outs of the MixWizard and six line-level outputs labeled in pairs; a left and right output for High, Mid, and Low. In our rig you will also notice that all of these outputs except for the Low right output are being used. The Left/Mono output of the DriveRack goes directly to the ’SUB OUT’ in the I/O panel (see Figure 2). The Mid outputs go into the QS GX7 as I will explain shortly, and the High outputs go to the ’MAIN OUTS’, also in the I/O panel. You can effectively ignore the ’HIGH’ ’MID’ ’LOW’ labels on these outputs, as we are not using them as crossover outs for distinct speaker drivers like the names suggest. The DriveRack has crossovers and tunings already set up for each of these pairs and combinations of outputs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, most all of the uses of the DriveRack have already been set up and need not be touched, however the main feature of this machine which we put to use often is the automatic feedback eliminator. This is an extremely useful feature for working in smaller spaces like the Cafe or the Penthouse, especially when you run the risk of having a performer or speaker accidentally step in front of the PA with his or her microphone. The feedback eliminator detects feedback and automatically puts a sharp cut at that particular frequency, effectively eliminating the potential for feedback at that frequency. The DriveRack has up to six of these automatic filters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To use the automatic feedback filters hit the button labeled ’FEEDBACK’ in the upper righthand corner of the button matrix to the right of the jog wheel. This will take you to a screen that looks something like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/18 Filters use.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 18&quot; /&gt;
Figure 18: Example of the DBX DriveRack digital screen showing Feedback filters in use.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The six ’F’s on the lower left of the screen represent your six automatic feedback filters. If they are highlighted in white as in the picture above, this means that they are active and have already been placed at a particular frequency. To clear the filters and prepare them to detect new frequencies, push the jog wheel to the right of the screen directly down, this will switch your digital arrow indicator between the ’ON’ and ’Clear’ parameters. Once you are on the ’Clear’ parameter slowly spin the jog wheel clockwise to toggle from ’Live Filters’ to ’All Filters.’ Once you have ’All Filters’ selected push the jog wheel down again to move your indicator down and then slowly spin the wheel clockwise another notch. This should clear all of your filters and put them back in a sort of standby position, ready to detect and cut any feedback frequencies they detect. If you did this correctly the digital screen should now look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/19 filters no use.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 19&quot; /&gt;
Figure 19: Example of the DBX DriveRack digital screen showing Feedback filters on standby.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ie: the ’F’ filters should no longer be highlighted in white. Typically at this point you want to announce to those in the room that you will be inducing feedback and give them a chance to leave or cover their ears, then take your mic, and slowly gain it up while talking into it until you start to hear feedback form. The device takes a second or two to recognize the feedback, however once it does you should hear it place the cut, eliminating the feedback and you should see one of the ’F’ filters go white on the digital screen. For more information on the details of this part of the rack simply refer to the DBX DriveRack PA+ website here to take a look at the user manual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dbx-231s-graphic-equaliser&quot;&gt;6. DBX 231s Graphic Equaliser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/20 DBX 231s.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 20&quot; /&gt;
Figure 20: DBX 231s Graphic Equaliser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 231s is a dual channel graphic EQ that works as an inserted effect just like the Lexicon and DBX compressors. You will find two more unplugged quarter inch TRS cables in the back of the rig labeled GEQ 1 and 2 respectively which you can insert into whatever channel you would like. The graphic EQ is typically used on the main LR output inserts in order to gain a master EQ on your master bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 231s is split into two sections, one for each channel. Each one has a 20 - 20k Hz range graphic EQ with a gain knob, an input meter, a clip meter, a bypass button, a 50 Hz low cut switch, and a range switch that changes the range of the EQ from ± 6 to ± 12 dB. This effectively changes the sensitivity of the nodes/center frequencies on the EQ. You might want to use the ± 12 dB button when you are trying to manually eliminate a potential feedback frequency, since you would want a deeper cut for this purpose. You might use the ± 6 dB button when you are trying to fine tune your speakers, since for this purpose you shouldn’t in theory be cutting anything more than a few dB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;dbx-215-graphic-equaliser&quot;&gt;7. DBX 215 Graphic Equaliser&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/21 DBX 215.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 21&quot; /&gt;
Figure 21: DBX 215 Graphic Equaliser&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes the DBX 215 units are essentially identical to the 231s above, however they are routed differently. You will see that we have two channels of 215s. These have been dedicated to the purpose of monitor processing. There are two quarter inch cables on the back of the rack labeled MONS 1 and 2 that should be inserted in AUX outputs 1 and 2. The other ends of these two cables are plugged into the inputs on these top two GEQs. These are NOT to be used as inserts on input channel strips. The outputs of these two GEQs can be found in the I/O panel labeled as MONS 1 and 2 respectively. This means that when you send signal to AUX 1 or 2, that signal is now sent through a GEQ on its way to your monitor, giving you the option to ’ring out’ your monitors if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term ’ring out’ monitors in the audio world refers to the process of removing any potential feedback via graphic equalizer from the monitors. You will need two people to do this. One person ’drives,’ or stands with a microphone on stage effectively trying to induce feedback in each monitor. When this person starts to hear feedback, he or she should roughly estimate the frequency of feedback (this process requires extensive experience and a fair amount of relative pitch. Unless you have a spectrum analyzer on your phone, you would typically just do this by ear) and communicate that frequency to the other person who should be standing at the front of house console (in this case the mobile rig) who would then cut that frequency in the GEQ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;shure-ulxp4-wireless-microphone-receivers&quot;&gt;8. Shure ULXP4 Wireless Microphone Receivers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/audio/Mobile Rig Guide Pics/22 ULXP4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Figure 22&quot; /&gt;
Figure 22: Shure ULXP4 Wireless Microphone Receivers&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the receivers for the two wireless Beta 58s that can be found in the pullout drawer. Their channels are labeled ’W1’ and ’W2’ on the mix console. The receivers exist in order to receive the signal from the wireless microphone, convert it to a voltage and send it to your input channel. The signal from the microphone to the receiver is sent over radio frequency, indicated by the combination of letters and numbers you can see on the both the microphones and their corresponding receivers. The receivers, in addition to the microphones, have an internal volume parameter, given by the knob between the jog wheel and the power switch. This should not be touched and should be left at 100 percent (about five o’clock). The receivers also have a jog wheel used to change frequencies and settings, a ’Mode’ button and a ’Set’ button, in addition to the power switch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These receivers have more settings and capabilities then you might imagine, but you don’t typically have to mess with anything on them. If anything, you may have to change the group and channel (frequency) on the microphone, also known as the transmitter. If you ever are having problems with a wireless microphone and notice that the group and channel on the microphone do not match up with the corresponding receiver, only make changes to the transmitter and NEVER to the receiver. That being said, ONLY begin trying to change the microphone frequency if you feel comfortable doing so. If this is where you find yourself, read on to find out how to change the microphone frequency to match its receiver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The microphone frequency settings should always be locked when in regular use. That is, when you turn on the mic you should see a small lock icon on the right of the screen indicating that the mode and set buttons are locked and will not allow you change the group and channel of the transmitter. To unlock hold the set button and turn off the mic. Continuing to hold the set button, turn the mic back on. You should see the letters ’Fr UL’ for ’Frequency Unlocked’ appear first on the screen. Now use the mode button to switch between the ’Group’ and ’Channel’ of the transmitter and use the set button to get to a specific group and channel. When you have reached your desired group or channel, simply press the mode button to switch to the next section, or if you are already in channel mode, to return to the home screen. Your new group and channel should be showing up. If you have successfully changed your transmitter frequency in this way, please lock the microphone again by holding the ’set’ button, turning the mic off, and turning it back on, all the while continuing to hold the set button. You should now see the letters ’Fr L’ for Frequency Locked appear for a few seconds when the mic switches on.&lt;/p&gt;

Figure 23: QSC GX7 Amplifier&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The QSC GX7 Loudspeaker Amplifier is used to power our EV TX1122 loudspeakers. These speakers are ’passive’ which means they require an external power source and crossover, as opposed to ’active speakers’ like our JBL PRX612Ms, which are self-powered with a built in crossover. The QSC GX7 takes a split of the main output of the MixWizard (coming from the ’Mid’ outputs of the DriveRack as mentioned above) and amplifies it to speaker level, sending it out along with power through the PASSIVE OUTS on the I/O panel via Speakon NL2 cable. The two volume knobs on the face of the unit should both be set to 10, and the power button should never be touched, as it turns on with the rest of the equipment with the Furman.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Guide to Soft Goods</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/soft-goods-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/soft-goods-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;a-guide-to-the-performance-halls-soft-goods&quot;&gt;A Guide to the Performance Hall’s Soft Goods&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people refer to as “curtains” are actually called “soft goods” within the technical theater community. As opposed to “hard goods,” soft goods have the capability to fold. These goods include items such as legs, borders, scrims, full stage blacks, and grand curtains (also referred to as main curtain). The Performance Hall at the University of Chicago has all of these. This section guides you through identifying, hanging, folding, and handling these various soft goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every soft good’s basic components are in relation to how it hangs on stage. A good’s top, bottom, back and front are easily identifiable even when folded. When one of these goods is set up on stage, the top refers to the end near the ceiling, the bottom to the end at the floor, the front refers to the side facing the audience, the back is the side the audience can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the top of the good is a row of lengths of tie line. These tie lines are used to attach it to the pipe. When tying these lines to a batten, use a knot like tying your shoes. First, tie a simple half hitch, or what is commonly known as a single knot. Then, finish with a bow. Never tie a double knot. The ties on every good are all black except for one white tie; the white tie is your center tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hanging a soft good, first determine if it requires fullness or tautness (a loose or a tight look). Our borders and legs usually require fullness whereas our scrim and the full stage black need to be hung taut. Knots should be tight against the batten pipe unless instructed otherwise.  Never hang soft goods on a batten where they will be in direct contact with lights. This is a fire hazard. Talk to your supervisor and the visiting production team to determine a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top of the good is a handwritten label, naming the good and giving specifications related to the size of the good. When taking down and folding it, the label must always end up on the outside of the roll so future stagehands can easily identify it. You’ll notice only the Legs and Film Screen Masking curtains have chain at the bottom. The purpose of this chain is to stretch the good down to the stage and keep it from moving if touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always have a buddy or two helping when folding soft goods. It is possible to fold solo, but it is very, very hard. Before flying-in any soft good, first &lt;strong&gt;clear the deck&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sweep the floor&lt;/strong&gt;! We want to keep our curtains looking tidy for a number of good reasons. Never walk on any of the soft goods with shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying-in any batten, pull together a ground crew to watch the pipe from stage level. While watching the pipe for possible collisions, your ground crew should also do an initial rough accordion folding of the curtain, making sure the front velour doesn’t accidentally fall forward onto the floor. Do not pull it too hard on the curtains as you fold them; you do not want to put too much stress on the rigging or move the pipe much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the batten has stopped moving, untie the goods and fly the pipe out again so there is nothing in the way while folding. Before you start moving the curtain around and spreading it out to fold, make sure all of the front is always face up and the back is face down. The back is a rougher texture than the velvety front, so it’s easy to tell the difference. It is important that the good rolls only on its back, so as to “save face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay the first curtain out flat onstage. Each good is folded differently, so have a clear plan on how you will fold each one before you do. Most of our curtains are folded bottom to top (as many times as needed) then rolled from one side to the other, as to fit into the bin, with the &lt;strong&gt;information label facing out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folding (with your buddy) run one side’s corners to the other side’s corner trying to catch air in between the top and bottom sections. Capturing air also makes folding easier, resulting in less drag and allows you a few moments to fix problem areas with ease. Have a third person catching and realigning the center lines as they will be the biggest problems. Always remember to make sure your lines are even and edges match. Do not forget about the bottom half just because you can’t see it anymore! Each piece should be flat and even. If your fold has overshot the bottom edge, redo the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Legs are used to create wings. They come in pairs, one hung with fullness on each side of the stage on the same batten. The Performance Hall has four sets of legs. Keep each leg with its buddy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior to hanging legs, determine whether you need pipe extensions in each end of the batten.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also, determine how far onstage the legs are needed for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First tie the onstage and offstage ties where you want them, then tie the center tie line. Now you have 2 identical sections that need their centers tied. Once those are tied, you will have 4 sections that need their centers tied. Continue to tie 50% marks until all ties are evenly spaced and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flying the batten out, the person running the rigging console is responsible for gathering a ground crew and ensuring that nothing crashes into the architecture. The ground crew (of at least 2 people) is responsible for watching the pipe and attachments, as well as physically unfolding the legs as they fly. ALWAYS have eyes on both ends of the batten as you fly it out so that you don’t damage the walls, ceiling, the battens or other people on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are dirty, stop flying them out and clean them as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person at scene control must stop the batten before it reaches its upper limit where it sits in its ceiling pocket. With the extensions in, it will not fit; it must sit below its home. Again, ALWAYS watch the batten as you raise it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the legs far enough out so their bottoms sit just barely on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk up to FOH to double check that they are evenly placed on stage. If they’re not perfectly even or end up covering the speakers, redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the leg out the length of the stage, front side face up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legs are folded over twice (side to side), and then rolled bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once laid out, check where the label is on the top section. This side will remain on the floor as you fold toward it so it is on the outside when you put the leg away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one edge starts to cone inwards while the other cones out, unroll and reroll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware at this point that one side of the good may be thicker than the other. The thicker side should be kept as tight as possible. The other should loosen just enough to keep it even.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the rolled leg into the bin using the help of gravity. Tipping the bin and rolling the good inside will usually be harder than picking the good up and dropping it inside, but can be done if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Borders are used with legs to complete the proscenium look. They are also used to hide other things hanging in the air, such as lights &amp;amp; other things in the air. They run the width of the stage, but only hang down a few feet from the ceiling. Our borders are also used as a skirt to mask the bottom of the film screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s borders are stored in the same bins as the legs. Borders would normally be hung 1 pipe downstage of a set of legs, but because our space was designed with some oddities, there’s really only one good place to hang a border and that’s U3. U3 is special because it does not interfere with the lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as with the legs, use the 50% rule when tying the border to the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the batten out all the way, always keeping eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The border itself is much longer than the width of the stage, so open the downstage panels to allow yourself more room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lay the border out so the center is farther offstage and prepare the first half by spreading it out and laying the onstage side flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold this edge to the center line evenly and then pull the border across the stage to give yourself room to repeat the process with the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flatten out the unfolded side and fold to the center line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that you have the whole thing fitting on stage, fold the bottom to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s impossible to keep the label on the outside of a border, since we’ve brought both ends to the center, so just keep track of which one you’re working with before rolling and binning it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borders aren’t as easy to lift, but they’re still liftable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Stage Black (FSB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The full stage black is usually used to cover the upstage wall or to cut the depth of stage in half. In the Performance Hall, it can be hung from U3, U4, U6 and D-Light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the full stage black on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting at center and working offstage, tie every other tie until you reach the end of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back at center, pull your knots away from the center, pulling the fabric taut in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop when the bottom of the FSB rests on the deck of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold the good bottom to top, making sure to catch lots of air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this twice with the new bottom edge you have created, folding the good a total of three times, always bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the good so the label stays on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the hamper over and set it on it’s side, roll the good inside, and carefully tip it back up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will need another person to do this, the hamper will now be very heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrims (white and black)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Performance Hall has two scrims, a black scrim and a white scrim. They are stored in the same bin upstage but inside canvas bags to keep them from pilling on each other.  Unlike the other soft goods in the Performance Hall, scrims are used aesthetically, to both bounce and transmit light. They are often used in dance pieces, alongside a ground row of strip or cyc lights.  They are sometimes used as an alternate upstage projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the scrims are so light, they will need to be bottom-piped once they’re flown out. Bottom pipe can be found in the storage room across from the greenroom. They are the lightweight aluminum pipes that fit together, end to end. When bottom-piping the scrim, &lt;strong&gt;make sure the pipe sits in the inner nylon pocket, not the outer fabric pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrims are hung and folded in the same manner as the full stage black. When hanging, start in the center and work your way off stage then go back and pull tautness into the fabric. When folding, fold bottom to top 3 times before rolling toward the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hampers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All of the Performance Hall’s soft goods are stored in hampers that live along the upstage wall backstage. Each hamper is labelled according to its contents. The hampers are only just small enough to pass through the upstage corridor and downstage doors to the stage. Be careful when moving them, as their hinges may catch on the architecture. For extra precaution, open panels to get the bins onstage. Determine whether you need to lay the bin on its side before loading or unloading goods. If you do, lay it down with its open lid on the floor. Be aware of the locks! Be extremely careful to not scratch the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Guide to Laying and Striking Marley</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/marley-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/marley-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;marley-a-guide-to-laying-a-dance-floor&quot;&gt;Marley: A Guide to Laying a Dance Floor&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marley is a type of dance floor. It allows dancers to move easily across the deck and offers more give, resulting in higher and more efficient jumps. Marley comes in heavy vinyl strips. These strips are about four feet wide and span the length of the stage. To both lay out and strike marley, you need at least two people. Ideally, you have a crew of four: two to tape down a strip while the other two prep the next strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s marley is stored on pieces of white PVC pipe backstage right. When the flooring is down, the empty rolls can live backstage left, preferably upstage and out of the way. To lay the marley you’ll start offstage right. When rolling it back up you’ll start offstage left. The bottom of the marley will be on the outside of the roll; make sure the correct side is face up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before marley is laid out, the stage should be swept thoroughly. The Performance Hall’s marley is cut into seven panels (1 = upstage, 7 = downstage apron). Each is labeled. If for some reason you can’t find the label, relabel it using gaff tape and a sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay a marley floor you will need: marley tape, scissors/a blade, at least one buddy, knee pads (optional). While Marley tape is black like gaff tape, it is smooth and shiny in texture. Do not use gaff tape on the marley; it will leave behind a residue. When you need to cut marley tape, use scissors or a blade. Don’t try to tear the marley tape, it’s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both laying and striking the marley, the wings stage left and right should be open. The marley will lie underneath them. Be careful when sliding the marley under each panel; go too far and you’ll hit a hinge and need to readjust. Try not to cover any of the panel locking drop holes so you can still lock them into place if needed. Be aware that the Performance Hall’s stage is trapezoidal. The upstage wall is shorter than the downstage edge and the marley is cut to match this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laying Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Beginning the process:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, move the roll #6 of marley to the stage right, downstage corner. The rolls are very heavy, so be careful and work in a team when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best way to move the marley is to slowly walk the roll over on its end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the marley onto the floor so the longer edge is downstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the pieces of tape holding the roll together. If any tape goo is left on the marley, clean it before laying it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the marley fully by pushing the roll across the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the PVC pipes in the backstage left corner, upstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, align the edges of the marley with off stage walls. Once it’s even on both sides and kissing the lip, park it and tape it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are no bubbles, tape the stage left and right sides down first. Use three pieces of tape running off stage (one upstage, one downstage and one center) to anchor both sides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are bubbles, tape one side down and have one person kneel on that edge to hold it in place. Have a second person on the other edge pulling toward themselves and a third person stomp across toward the second person. Once the third person has crossed the stage, the second person will tape their edge down before the third person steps off the marley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Taping lengthwise:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start offstage right and work your way stage left as a team (or vice versa).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will hold the tape down while the Tech B creates a long stretch of slack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before touching the tape down, Tech B will stretch it taut and carefully hold it over the seam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will then smoothly press the tape onto the ground (moving toward Tech B) and check for any irregularity along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue this process across the length of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Techs A and B are taping Panel 6, Techs C and D should be prepping the next panel, laying the rest of the panels out in order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When securing section #7, tape slowly and try to follow the curve of the lip smoothly. If you must fold tape over the stage edge, do so, but do it neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have irregularity, fix the issue before moving on. Irregularity can create dangerous situations for dancers who are unaware of the problem. Here are some situations you would fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the marley is overlapping under the tape, either press it out or lift up and start again. A small gap between panels is better than overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a bubble in the marley itself, stomp it out in the direction you’re taping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your roll runs out of tape, cut that edge straight, tape it down and grab a new roll. Line up the new piece of tape carefully to ensure clean overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just laid your own dance floor! Only one more thing to do before you take a break: dry sweep and mop the marley flooring. Use a bit of the Roscoe Marley Floor Cleaner in your bucket of water but nothing else. If an outside stage manager wants to use something else, ask your supervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every rehearsal or performance on marley, the stage must be swept and then mopped. Mop in smooth figure eights across the stage pulling the dirt toward you and not pushing it out away from you. Clean one strip at a time. When you’ve pulled all the dirt to one end of the stage, use the mop to pick up the dirt and deposit it into the water bucket. Do not walk on the marley until it is dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using marley alongside soft goods, always roll marley out first. When you need to sweep and mop the marley while soft goods are in, fly the goods out about a foot. This will allow you to clean the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking the Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Striking marley is far easier than laying it. If there are soft goods hanging that touch the floor, sweep the stage and strike the soft goods first. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sweep and mop one last time. Wait for the marley to dry. DO NOT roll the marley up if it is wet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove all of your tape. (Make a giant tape ball, if you’d like! Play with it, name it, take it home, and shower it with unconditional love. Don’t shower with it.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your PVC pipes. Always roll panels stage left to stage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting downstage left (Strip #7), tape the edge of the marley to your PVC pipe at three points; top, center and bottom (Strips #7 and #6 have unique edges that will only need one or two strips of tape to anchor them to the PVC pipe).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are taping the marley to the pipe in a way that will allow you to roll the marley in a straight line the entire length of the floor.  One side should always be flush with the pipe edge but not overextending over the end of the pipe edge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you find that you have lost sight of the pipe on your straight edge, unroll and start over.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you get to the end, make sure you still have the one exposed PVC pipe edge you’ve been working hard to maintain throughout the length of the roll.  This is the side the marley will stand on when stored upright.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it looks good and your edge is straight, you’re ready to tape the rolled up marley to itself (again top, center, and bottom).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double check that it has not lost its label. If it has, make a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand the rolled up marley in its home backstage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DO NOT store upright unsupported by the PVC pipe with the weight on the edge of the flooring itself. This will cause the ends to bend and crease in ways that will damage the marley long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Genie Guide</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/genie-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/genie-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;genie-use--safety&quot;&gt;Genie Use &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To use the genie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Lighting Basics</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/lighting/lighting-basics.html"/>
   <updated>2016-09-04T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/lighting/lighting-basics</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;lighting-basics&quot;&gt;Lighting Basics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work a lighting call, you should have a basic set of tools: a crescent-wrench, a flashlight, and a pair of gloves. The Performance Hall has extras of all of these, but it is worth investing in your own to guarantee that there are enough tools for everyone and that yours fit you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember to note any changes you make and to put those notes in a place where others can see (eg: on the lighting board or on the scene control). Follow the plot as best as you can. If the architecture of the hall or work lights get in your way, talk to your supervisor and the lighting designer to come up with a compromise. Keep track of the dimmers you plug each unit into so the Patch on the board can be updated. Confirm that it is okay to modify the rep plot if any changes are being made to it, and make sure the rep plot is restored after the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four permanent hanging positions in the Performance Hall: Catwalk 1, Catwalk 2, U5, and U7. If a designer requests lights in another location, consult your supervisor before moving on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-definitions&quot;&gt;Basic Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unit:&lt;/u&gt; refers to the entire lighting instrument.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Yoke:&lt;/u&gt; the squared piece of metal, open on one side, which connects the unit to its mounting hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Tee-handle:&lt;/u&gt; Located on the side of the yolk, the tee-handle controls the tilt of the light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Lamp:&lt;/u&gt; In theater lighting, light bulbs are called lamps. The units in the Performance Hall can take either 575 or 750 watt lamps. We currently only stock 575w. Lamps of all kinds are kept in the backstage cabinet. NEVER touch the glass on a new theatrical lamp with your bare skin. The oil from your fingers will cause the lamp to explode when it heats up. Use gloves, the foam it was packaged in, or the corner of your shirt to cover the lamp while you work with it. Always turn off and unplug (excluding the orchestra lights, which are hardwired) a unit before your change a lamp. Place dead lamps in the assigned box in the cabinet backstage and recycle the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gel:&lt;/u&gt; Called gels because they were originally made of gelatin, modern gels are made of acetate (same material as transparencies). Gels are used to change the color of the light or fuzz the hard edges of a beam (called frost or diffusion gels). They come in a variety of colors. The Performance Hall stocks primarily gel made by Rosco (identified with an R before the number). We also might have a few miscellaneous sheets of Lee, Apollo, and GAM gels, identified with L, A, or G before the number). If possible, always use Rosco colors for consistency. When cutting gel, always label cuts and extra pieces with the appropriate letter and number using the China marker on the gel table. Always cut to the inside of the tape lines on the gel cutter. Do not use this cutter for anything but gel. The numbers on gels are assigned according to their place in the color spectrum. Remember that Rosco gels with numbers in the 300s, such as R343, were added in after the official spectrum was set out and are slightly modified versions of existing colors. Therefore, R343 comes between R43 and R44, and is a modified version of R43. Darker gels tend to burn through faster as they block more of the light spectrum from transmission, converting more energy into heat, though you can combat this with heat shield(R1991 or L269), installed before the gel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gel Frame:&lt;/u&gt; Gel frames are used to hold cuts of gel in place in front of a unit. They come in a variety of sizes, 6 ¼” (for Leko’s), 7 ½” (for pars), and 12” (for 10 degree Lekos). Open the gel clip on the front of the unit by sliding it to the side to unlock and then flipping it up. Then, drop the gel frame into the slot closer to the unit (to minimize light leak) and make sure it is secure on all 4 sides. If using heat shield, it should be on the inside of the gel.  When hung correctly, the gel clip should sit on the top of the unit. Make sure the gel clip is down once the gel frame is in and everything is secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Safety:&lt;/u&gt; A safety is a specialized piece of aircraft cable with a carabiner on one end and a loop on the other. A safety is used to ensure that if any piece of hardware on the unit should fail, the unit will not fall from the pipe and hurt anyone/anything below. Always remember to secure the safety on the unit to the pipe. Additionally, secure the safety underneath any cable running on the pipe. Should the safety be necessary, you do not want it to cut through any live cable and electrify the unit and pipe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Tail:&lt;/u&gt; refers to the male plug coming out of the unit. When hung correctly, the tail should come out of the bottom of the unit. Never tie up the tail, always tie the extension to the pipe instead. Give yourself enough room for focus when running cable to a light. Tie the circuit as close to the unit as possible. When done focusing, tuck the tail into the yoke of the unit to make your work as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Conventional Light:&lt;/u&gt; Any light where everything is manually controlled except for the brightness of the incandescent lamp, which is plugged into a dimmer circuit. Used to differentiate them from Intelligent/LED/moving lights. All stage lights in the performance hall currently are Conventional lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Practical:&lt;/u&gt; This is a standard light (not a stage light) that might be needed on stage, like a desk lamp. To control it from the board, you will need to use a stage-pin to female edison adapter to connect to the light to a dimmer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Electric:&lt;/u&gt; A flown batten over the stage on which stage lights are hung (a hanging position). Usually, lighting circuits are attached to it or nearby for convenience. In the performance hall, our permanent electrics are U5 and U7.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dead-hung:&lt;/u&gt; when the light is hung with the yolk directly under the pipe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Yolked out:&lt;/u&gt; when the light is hung with the yolk out away from the pipe, often at a 90° angle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;RFU:&lt;/u&gt;  Remote Focus Unit. This is essentially a remote for the lighting board and allows you to access many of its functions without taking the whole light board with you. You should take it with you if you are focusing lights, as it will make your life vastly easier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;DMX:&lt;/u&gt; DMX or, Digital MultipleX, is a protocol used to control lighting instruments that do more than just dim so we can have digital control over all their attributes from the lighting board. DMX cable is 5-pin XLR and various lengths are stored in the shelving next to the metal cabinet backstage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Ethercon:&lt;/u&gt; Ethercon is Ethernet cable in a fancier housing. It is gradually replacing DMX as the lighting communication protocol. In the hall, we have lighting ethernet ports around the theater (labeled Lighting Network). To convert Ethercon to DMX, you will need a DMX node (stored in the shelving next to the metal cabinet). This plugs into the lighting network via ethercon and will output DMX to lights that require it. If it is not working, ask your shift leader for help configuring these nodes as they are quite complex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Bench focus:&lt;/u&gt; The beam of the unit will naturally tend to have a hot-spot, where the light is the brightest in the center of the beam. To reduce the difference between the brightness hot-spot of the beam (center) and the brightness of the outer edges of the beam, you must bench focus the unit. If it is benched all the way to peak, the center will be much brighter, while if it is benched all the way to flat, the center will be darker than the rest of the circle. Peak benching is better when one is blending multiple units together to evenly wash the stage (as it reduces the brightness of overlap between fixtures), while flat is better the rest of the time. Inside a unit, the lamp sits inside a spherical reflector. Essentially, bench focusing adjusts the vertical lamps placement within the reflector, changing the beam of light. To bench focus a Strand LekoLite, twist the black knob on the back of the unit, testing each direction. To bench focus an ETC source 4, also twist the black knob on the back of the unit, not the gold one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dimmer:&lt;/u&gt; The physical power module that dims the circuit that the fixture is plugged into. Older dimmers used resistance to dim, but those were bulky and inefficient, so modern dimmers dim by chopping the sine wave of the electricity. They only work with incandescent sources, and so you should never plug in non-incandescent devices into theatrical dimmers. Our dimmers are rated for 20 Amps/2.4 KW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Non-dim/relay:&lt;/u&gt; A circuit that provides constant, switchable power that does not dim, used for power to devices with more capabilities than conventional lights and separate digital control signal (Intelligent/LED/moving lights)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Circuit:&lt;/u&gt; Where you plug the light into on the wall. If hard-patched 1:1, the circuit number corresponds to the dimmer number that the board can control to turn the light on and off.  The hall is no longer patched 1:1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Channel:&lt;/u&gt; An arbitrary number that you can soft-patch to any address/dimmer for your convenience on the lighting board, i.e. It would be easiest for you to have your frontlight in channels 1-10 rather than having to remember each individual dimmer number every unit is plugged into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Submaster:&lt;/u&gt; A number of channels at different levels that you can control together as a group on a fader. We have recorded our most often used groups of lights on Sub Page 1 for easy access. If you need to program a special group of lights for a show, program them into another Sub Page (2 or 3 most likely).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cue:&lt;/u&gt; A snapshot of the state of all lighting in the space; the building blocks of a cue list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cuelist/Cue Stack:&lt;/u&gt; A programmed list of all the different lighting looks for a show and the times to get from one to the next. You advance to the next cue in a cuelist by hitting the “go” button on the light board and to go backwards by hitting the “halt/back” button.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Live:&lt;/u&gt; If you are in ‘live’ mode on the light board, anything you program will appear immediately on stage and in the house.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Blind:&lt;/u&gt; A screen on the light board that allows you to program without modifying the live light levels in the house and on stage; a good way to make many needed changes without going dark on the performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kinds-of-lights&quot;&gt;Kinds of Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;ERS (Ellipsoidal Reflector Spot):&lt;/u&gt; Also called Lekos or Profiles, these are the most flexible type of conventional (incandescent) light. The Performance Hall has two brands of ERS units: those made by E.T.C. (called a Source 4) and by Strand (called a Leko Lite). In general, the units are pretty much the same, though they differ in lamps (and how to change one), placement of barrel knobs (and extra bits), amount of heat given off (beware, Leko Lites get much hotter than Source 4s and will burn through gels with less output to the unit) and weight, but otherwise the units are pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barrel:&lt;/u&gt; Also known as Lens Tubes, barrels sit on the front of the units. They contain lenses, sitting at various distances from one another in order to create a specific beam size. Barrels come in a variety of “degrees”: 10°, 19°, 26°, 36°, and 50°.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The smaller the degree of the lens, the smaller the beam spread.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Barrels are interchangeable between units made by the same manufacturer (Leko Lite barrels work in all Leko Lites, Source 4 barrels in all Source 4s).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For both kinds of units, the barrel knobs are located on the bottom of the unit. If barrels are taken out of bodies (the entire unit minus the barrel), keep the barrel knobs with the barrel! Be wary, the Strand barrel knobs have tiny bits of extra hardware. Try not to lose these.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be extremely careful when changing barrels on lights that are hung and make sure no one is under you (announce your presence so that everyone in the house can hear you).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To focus a unit’s beam, loosen the barrel knob just a bit while holding onto the front of the barrel to prevent if from falling and slide the barrel up and down in the body to the desired beam sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shutter:&lt;/u&gt; Shutters are used to create straight cuts on an otherwise circular beam. There are four shutters in total, located halfway down the body of a unit. Shutters affect the beam opposite to what you would expect, i.e.: push in a top shutter, get a bottom cut, push in a stage right shutter, get a stage left cut, etc. If you cannot make a cut at a necessary  angle, rotate the barrel.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To rotate the barrel on an ETC source 4, loosen the knob on the bottom of the unit by the bottom shutter (not the barrel knob) enough to spin the body. Tighten the knob again and make your cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To rotate the barrel on a Strand Lekolite, loosen the flat knob on the right side of the unit near the Tee-Handle enough to spin the body. Tighten the knob again and make your cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replacing Lamps:&lt;/u&gt; Burnt lamps should have visibly damaged filaments and be placed in the dead lamp bin found on top of the lighting storage shelving unit.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in an ETC unit (either source 4 or PAR) you will need an HPL 575w:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the golden screw on the back on the unit and remove the cap.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unlatch the pins (in source 4 only) and pull the old lamp out.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Put in the new lamp and relatch the pins.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Replace the cap by aligning the ridges on the back of the unit and tighten the golden screw.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a Strand unit, you will need a NPA Phillips FastFit 575w:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Flip open the back of the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the lamp with the help of pliers, and take it out.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Place the new lamp in the back of the unit and screw it into place.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Flip the cover back into place.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Leko Lites and Source 4s all take 6 1/4” gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fresnel:&lt;/u&gt; (named after the inventor of the special lens made up of concentric circles in the fixture) - Note: The performance hall does not stock these, but we do rent/use them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses a fixed lens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lamp housing and reflector move back and forth within the housing to go from a wide beam spread (lamp moved towards the lens) to a narrow beam spread (lamp slides away from the lens). There will be a knob or crank that allows you to slide the lamp and reflector back and forth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soft, circular, wash beam (sharp focus impossible), but good for blending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slot in the front for gel frames/accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;PAR&lt;/u&gt; (Parabolic Anbolized Reflector): These produce a soft, elliptical beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lens: We have S4 PARs, which have interchangeable lenses to achieve different beam spreads:
Very Narrow Spot (VNSP): Clear glass. Creates a 15° beam shape.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Narrow Spot (NSP): Slightly foggy, stippled glass. Creates a 19° beam shape.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium Flood (MFL): Checkered with seven lines. Medium lenses create a 21°x34° oblong beam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wide Flood (WFL): Checkered with more than seven lines. Wide lenses create a 30°x51° oblong beam shape.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just like with shutters, the lenses in S4 PARs work in opposites. If the lens’ lines run upstage-downstage, your beam will run stage left-stage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change the shape of the beam, you may rotate the lens (lamp assembly in other PARs), rotating the oblong shape. Just behind the gel frame, you will feel ridges, and if you push against the ridges, the lens will spin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;S4 PARs take 7 ½” gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;CYC Light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The performance hall does not own any cyc lights, but we frequently rent them. They are open-faced/flood lights (usually seated on the floor because of no space on the electrics) that serve to solidly light the white scrim/cyc (frequently hung on DLight) in any color via oversized gels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are large and cumbersome, and have enormous gel frames (size depending on the manufacturers and models).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They have asymmetric reflectors which means that vertically in one direction the light will spread infinitely while in the other there is a defined cutoff to the beam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the lights are mounted on the floor, the defined cutoff should be focused to the bottom of the cyc. If hung, focused to the top of the cyc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only focus adjustment on these lights is pan and tilt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intelligent/LED Lights:&lt;/u&gt; Occasionally there will be events in the hall that rent intelligent lights (ones with motorized pan and tilt are often referred to as Movers) that are more capable than conventional lights as they have multiple attributes (like pan and tilt, or color, or zoom) that can be controlled remotely from the lighting board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These will often be quite a bit heavier than lights you are used to and have different clamping mechanisms so it is often advisable to hang these with another person to help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They cannot be plugged into the stage pin dimmers. They must, must be connected to non-dimmed power, and the 20Amp non-dim relays that are located on all the lighting positions are the best choice for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They will also need DMX cable run to them and daisy chained between them. So that the board and identify them and control them, a different DMX address will need to be set on each of them, between 1-512, and then told to the lighting designer in the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you do not know what to do with such lights, ask for help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Follow-spot:&lt;/u&gt; The Performance Hall has two followspots, both Lycian SuperArc 400. Followspots are used in shows where a performer moves around the stage and needs to be seen while moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good followspot operator can predict where the beam of the followspot will land before the light is turned on. Additionally, a followspot operator should be as steady as possible. Never jump with the followspot, as it looks ugly to the audience. If you miss your spot, move slowly and with purpose to pick up your cue. This requires practice. Before running followspot for a show, give yourself some time to warm up and get used to the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Followspots have the capability to change color, depending on what gels are dropping in the five slots.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Iris changes the size of the beam, the dowser dims it, and the shutter/horizontal dowser dowses the beam horizontally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To use to the followspot:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure it is plugged into the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the switch on the back right side of the unit to turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stand (or sit on a tall stool) on the right side of the followspot. You will control the unit from the right at all times, holding the two handles labelled “control” to move the light.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Familiarize yourself with the various settings on the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Check the focus of your beam. Confirm with the lighting designer how sharp the edge should be.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gels in followspots do not fit a square gel frame. They are circular. Use an old gel cut from a followspot as reference when cutting new color. To change color in the followspot:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the followspot off and let it cool down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push all the gel frames into the up position.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the two screws by the gel changing levers.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Remove the entire section.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull the old color.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the old color with the new, securing it with brads or paperclips.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the entire section back in the followspot.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tighten the screws again.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Release the gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Test each color lever and reseat the color section if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;House Lights:&lt;/u&gt; The house lights in the Performance Hall are located in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th catwalks. Before each show, check that all the house lights are on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a house light you will need a PAR 38 lamp:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the switch on the handle to cut off the power running to the house light.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the wingnuts holding the base in the fixture. Put them in your pocket or somewhere safe where they won’t fall through the grating of the catwalk.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grab the handle and lift the base out of the fixture.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the old lamp.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Screw in the new lamp. You can touch these lamps with your bare hands.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Place the base back in the fixture.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the wingnuts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the house light switch back on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Catwalk Work Lights:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a catwalk work light, you will need a Biax T/E Eco 32w Lamp:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carefully balance yourself on the railings. If you do not have a buddy, you will need to climb down and back up while carrying things in order to finish this process.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the outer cage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the glass cover.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull out the old lamp.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not worry about touching these new lamps with your bare hands. Push in the new lamp and replace the covers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Music Stand Lights:&lt;/u&gt; Music stand lights are used when musicians are on stage, playing in the dark. They are stored in a bin in the new storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clip the music stand light onto the music stand and plug it into an Edison power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change lamps by unscrewing the old and screwing in a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To store a music stand light, coil the cable and place it over the lamp. Then, fold the clip up over the cable. By keeping the cable inside the body of the light, it will not become tangled with other lights in the bin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mounting&quot;&gt;Mounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units can be mounted on four kinds of hardware. As with all hardware you encounter, keep all the bits and pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;C-clamp:&lt;/u&gt; These are what you will find most units in the Performance Hall mounted on. Like their names, they are shaped like C’s. When hanging a unit on a C-clamp, hang it so the open side faces you. Then, tighten the bolt with a wrench.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tee:&lt;/u&gt; Used in tandem with sidearms. The bolt connects to the yoke of the unit, in place of the C-Clamp Remember to tighten both bolts on the tee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Floor plate:&lt;/u&gt; These are used for placing units on the floors. They are square pieces of wood with a hole in the center, with a bolt, a nut, and washers. Always keep the hardware with the floor plate so the next stagehand does not need to go searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Booms:&lt;/u&gt; 50 lb boom bases are located in the Southwest corner of backstage. Find the marked 10’, 1 ½” diameter boom pipes in the storage room across from the green room. Screw pipes tightly into bases, and then hang units either yoked out or on a side arm on either the up or downstage side of the pipe. Then, point them onstage. Be consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessories&quot;&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most common accessories sit in the outer frame of a unit. Always tie the safety length of tie line connected to the accessory to the yoke of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Top Hats:&lt;/u&gt;  Top hats are used to counter light spill. Named because they look like top hats, they can be used in source 4 or PAR units. We have Top Hats for S4 Pars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Half Hats or Tipton Hats:&lt;/u&gt; Like top hats, only cut in half lengthwise, so they only block half of the light beam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Barn Doors:&lt;/u&gt; Like top hats, only square-shaped, and, like shutters, you can move each section to cut off light from places you don’t want. Used in PARs and Fresnels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gobos:&lt;/u&gt; A gobo, also known as a template, is used to make a pattern on the stage. Gobos come in either metal (most commonly sizes A or B) or glass. The Performance Hall only has template holders for metal, size B. Gobos are only used in ERS units, but we only have holders for them for the Strand Leko Lites. Gobos are installed at the gate of the unit, where the lens and the reflector meet perfectly, where a perfectly in focus pattern is possible. Before placing a gobo in a unit, put it in a template holder. These can be found by the gels in Catwalk 4. To install a gobo on a Strand Lekolite, unscrew the gate cover, slide it open, and slide the template holder in. Close the gate as much as you can, and tighten the screws. To install a gobo on an ETC Source 4, slide the holder in just forward of the top shutter. Be careful, though, gobos get extremely hot very quickly, so be careful when removing them after the light has been on for some time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Irises:&lt;/u&gt; An iris in a lights acts just like an iris in an eye. Used to make beams even smaller, irises sit in the accessory slot forward of the gobo slot. To access this slot on an ETC Source 4, you will need to use a screwdriver to slide down the accessory slot cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting-equipment&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sniffer:&lt;/u&gt; These check for current in a wire or outlet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;GAM Check:&lt;/u&gt; It is a standardized troubleshooting device for stage pin connections. It has two settings, CABLE and [lamp], which represents a lamp. When the switch is flipped to the lamp setting, plug a unit into the female end of the GAM check. The GAM check will beep if the lamp is good. If it does not beep, change the lamp in the unit. To check if a unit is receiving power, flip to the CABLE setting and plug the male end of the GAM check into the female dimmer you are using. Turn the dimmer on at the board. If the dimmer is working, you will get three green LEDS on the GAM check. If you get another combination of lights, refer to the key on the GAM check itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-cable&quot;&gt;Types of Cable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable in the Performance Hall is labeled with electrical tape according to length. All lighting power cable is rated for at least 20 Amps and is SOOW (Extra hard usage, oil resistant, water resistant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Beige = 5’	Red = 10&#39;	Green = 25’	Blue = 50’	White =100’
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any piece of cable, there is a male and female end. They mean just what you would think: the male end is the one with pins sticking out, the female the end with holes. The male end will never be the live end (only female ends will be live so you can’t get electrocuted). Remember that, sadly, there is no homosexuality in electricity. The male always goes toward your power source (male is the input end, female the output). Be consistent when running cable by running it on one side of the pipe. Cable should be regularly tied off to pipe (using tie line) to prevent any slack from dangling. Excess cable should be neatly coiled and then tie lined to the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edison cable&lt;/u&gt; is the technical term for the standard A/C cable used in the United States, named for the almighty Thomas Edison (nah, Tesla was cooler). Therefore, the regular extension cords you are used to (if you grew up in the U.S.) are Edison.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stage Pin&lt;/u&gt; is used with theatrical lighting and is at least rated up to 20 Amps. Stage pin has three pins just like Edison cable, but is shaped like a flat square.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twistlock&lt;/u&gt; Similar pin layout to Edison, but the pins are curved. Twistlock cables are inserted, and then the connection is twisted until it locks (as you might expect from the name). The non-dim relay circuits (labeled with an S-) use twistlock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twofer&lt;/u&gt; is used to plug two lights into the same circuit. They look like a Y, with one male end and two female ends. Be careful to not overload the lighting circuit with too many lights (no more than four per circuit, preferably three).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adapters:&lt;/u&gt; The Performance Hall has a few kinds of adapters, Edison ➝ Stage Pin, Stage Pin ➝  Edison, and Twistlock ➝ Edison. If the male end is Edison, the unit plugged in will be non-dimmable. If the male end is Stage Pin, it will be able to dim. The Twistlock ➝ Edison adapters are used for connecting to the non-dim/relay circuits and running power towards intelligent/moving fixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multicable&lt;/u&gt;, or &lt;u&gt;Socopex&lt;/u&gt;, is essentially six stage pin circuits in one. The Performance Hall only has female soco above stage, over U5 and U7. To change from mult to stage pin, or from stage pin to mult, you will need one of the following.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-out: A male mult end with six female stage pins.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-in: A female mult end with six male stage pins.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-outs and break-ins can either be straight or staggered.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Straight: All the stage pins lengths are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Staggered: The stage pin lengths vary with 1 being the shortest and 6 being the longest.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When circuiting a pipe with a break-out, the six circuit numbers align one-to-one with the circuits you plugged the mult into. For example, if you plug the break-out into circuits 119-124, the stage pin labelled 1 will be dimmer 119, 2 will be 120, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-remember-when-hanging-and-focusing-lights&quot;&gt;Things to remember when hanging and focusing lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lights should (if possible) be spaced with at least 1’6” between each clamp so as to allow space for it to rotate and point differently during focus. The distance between your elbow and fingertips is approximately 1’6”, and so you can use your arm to measure as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lock everything down with your wrench. Only tighten bolts a quarter or half turn past finger tight, otherwise you begin to bend the bolt, weakening it, and making it more likely to break and fall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the safety cable is looped over the pipe and attached back to itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to pull all shutters. Otherwise, you will think the unit does not work even when turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tie a clove hitch when tying up cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never tie up the tail of the cable coming from the light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tie the female end of the circuit you are plugging into close to the unit, so you always have enough slack in the cable for the light to pointed in all manner of different directions (called a focus loop).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are running a long cable, label the female end of the cable with the circuit number it is plugged into using white gaff and a sharpy (stored on Catwalk 4). It will make you life vastly easier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any cable running in traveled walkways must be taped down in a clean manner and marked in white spike tape to ensure that people don’t trip. When needed, use a cable mat to cover the cable, and mark it in diagonal stripes of white spike tape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use gloves when focusing will prevent burns (especially with the Strand Leko Lites).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… And when striking lights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push in all shutters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run barrels in completely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrap the tail around the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang units in their appropriate storage space in the catwalks, tightening the bolt with only your fingers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-board-operation&quot;&gt;Light Board Operation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most modern light boards, the &lt;em&gt;Strand Light Palette Classic&lt;/em&gt; is composed of two main sections—the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; sections. The &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; section allows you to set up and program different lighting looks and adjust settings on the board, while the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; section allows you to recall those different looks in different manners. On the &lt;em&gt;Strand Light Palette Classic&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; section is mostly on your left, consisting of the twelve sliders (called submasters/looks) and associated buttons and the two groups of two sliders above  “Go” buttons (labeled AB and CD). The number and key pads, retractable keyboard and mouse on the right make up the &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; section. Outlined below are some basic operations of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On/Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To turn the board on, hit the power switch underneath the lip of the board, towards your left. To turn the board off, go to the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu, at the top left corner of the screen, click on &lt;strong&gt;Exit&lt;/strong&gt;, and then, after assuring it that you do want to exit and saving your show, click on the onscreen power button once the main interface has closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving/Opening Shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have made significant changes to the show, you’ll want to save your show as something new. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Save As&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu and enter the show name that you want. Save frequently by just clicking &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; to save the show with the same name. To open a show that you have worked on, click on &lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu and select the desired show file (don’t open the archive folders).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Softkeys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may notice that there is a line of keys numbered S1-S12. These are called softkeys and their functions change depending on what you are doing. Their functions are displayed in boxes along the bottom of the screen labeled S1-S12 so you know what they’ll do before you hit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To assign fixtures to different channel numbers than their dimmer/address for convenience (i.e. you might your front light to be in Channels 1-10 to make it easy to remember rather than having to remember the dimmers that they are plugged into), hit the button labeled “Patch.” This will take you to the patch screen and you’ll see a list of “fixtures” and “outputs.” “Fixtures” are what this board calls channels and “outputs” are dimmers/addresses. To assign a dimmer to a different channel, type in, on the keypad, first the number that you want that dimmer to be assigned to, followed by [@] then the number of the dimmer you are assigning, followed by [Enter]. For example, if I wanted dimmer #39 to be in channel #4, I would type in: 4 [@] 39 [Enter] The command line on the screen should read: “Patch Fixture 4 to Output 39.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the order of the syntax (fixture or output first), hit S11 (it should say on the screen “Patch by Output in the S11 box), and you can then enter the output first and then dimmer. With the same goal as the previous example, the syntax would then be: 39 [@] 4 [Enter], on the keypad and “Patch Output 39 to fixture 4” on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful when switching between syntaxes as you can easily make mistakes by thinking you are in one syntax when the board is set for the other. Always watch the command line to verify what you are typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selecting, Turning on, and Releasing a Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To turn on a channel and bring the light(s) associated with it up, type in the channel number on the keypad, then hit [@] and then enter the level (between 0-100% brightness) that you wish the channel to be at, then hit [Enter]. For example, if you wanted to turn on Channel 7 at 73%, you would type in: 7 [@] 73 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The channel that you put at 73% will be highlighted with a solid red box, showing that it is currently the selected channel. While it is selected, you can modify the level using the wheel at the right end of the light board, by using the [Up] or [Down] keys, by saying [@] and then another level, or by hitting the convenient [Full] or [Out] keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To release the channel from selection and turn it off (unless it was recorded into something), hit the [Undo] button. Hitting it multiple times will release channels that you had set to levels previously, restoring all the channels to their prior state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To select/turn on multiple channels, you can use the [Thru], [+], and [-] keys on the number pad, and you will have control over all of them. For example, if you wanted to turn on Channels 1-15, and 33, except for 11 all at Full, you would type in: 1 [Thru] 15 [+] 33 [-] 11 [@] [Full].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording a Submaster/Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Submaster (called a “look” on this board) is a group of channels that you can bring up to set levels together for convenience. An infinite number of looks can be recorded to different submaster “pages” (you can move between pages in the upper left hand corner of the screen). Looks number 1-12 in each page correspond to the twelve sliders on the left hand side of the board as well as the bottom row of “bump buttons” below the sliders. The bump buttons allow you to flash the look while you are holding it down and kill the look when you release it. Looks 13-24 you can access via the Bump Buttons buttons above the sliders, and 25-48 are in the two rows directly below the sliders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To record a look, set channels at their desired levels and then hit [Rec] and [Look] followed by the look’s number you want to record to and then [Enter]. You have to hit [Enter] twice to confirm that you want to overwrite an already recorded look. For example, if you wanted to record look 17, you would type in: [Rec] [Look] 17 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also record a look by hitting [Rec] [Look] and then hitting the bump button of the look you want, though this will only work for looks 1-48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may recall a look by hitting [Look] followed by the number of the Look you want and the level of its channels, then [Enter]. Those channels are now selected and you may modify them using the wheel or [Up] or [Down] keys. For example, if you wanted to recall Look 17 to 40%, you would type: [Look] 17 [@] 40 [Enter]. You may also recall looks using the submasters/bump buttons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording/Modifying a Cue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A cue is similar to a submaster in that it is a snapshot of lighting levels. Strung together, though, with timings, they are much more powerful. Cues work in an ordered list called a “Cuelist” or “Cue Stack” that follows the course of the production. To advance from one cue to the next, as the production progresses, hit the “Go button” at the appropriate moments underneath the playback sliders (AB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Record a Cue, set the lighting to the levels that you want, then hit [Rec] followed by the number of the Cue, then [Enter]. The number of the cue will determine the order in which it is played back, as the cuelist progresses from low to high. You may assign cues with numbers such as 14.3 if you need to insert a cue between two other cues, though it is often wise to start out leaving gaps in your numbering (numbering by 5s for example) to leave space for future cue insertions as decimal point cues can be cumbersome. For example, to record cue 10, you would type in: [Rec] 10 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assign a time other than the default time of three (the time it takes to crossfade from one cue to the next), hit [Cue] followed by the number of the cue, then [Time] and then the cue’s crossfade time. By hitting time twice and assigning times each time, you may assign separate up fade (lights coming in) and down fade (lights going out) times for a cue for more precise control over the crossfading. For example, if you wanted the lights in Cue 7 to go out faster than the lights in Cue 8 to come on, you would type, for example: [Cue] 8 [Time] 5 [Time] 3 [Enter]. That would create a cue with an uptime of 5 seconds and a downtime of 3 seconds. You can also give the cue a time when you are recording it. For example, you could type:
[Rec] 8 [Time] 6 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may assign a follow time to a cue as well, so that it will automatically execute the next cue after the follow time. For example: [Cue] 8 [Follow] 200.89. Cue 8 will now automatically advance into Cue 9 after 200.89 seconds. Be careful, the follow time starts counting down immediately when the cue starts, not after the fade time is executed, so if your follow time is less than your fade time, the next cue will start executing before the earlier one is finished fading in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update a cue, you may go to a cue, change the lighting levels as necessary, and then hit [Update].
To Delete a cue, you may hit the [Delete] button, followed by the Cue number, and then hit [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing Back Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To Go to a given cue, you may hit the [Goto] button followed by the cue number. You will then be in that cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Go to the next cue, in the time assigned to it, hit the [Go] button below the AB Playback Sliders. You may use the [Halt/Back] button if you need to stop a cue from fading in or go back to a past cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations! You have finished the Lighting Basics Section!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Tech Manual</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/employees/tech-manual.html"/>
   <updated>2016-09-01T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/employees/tech-manual</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;production-assistant-tech-manual&quot;&gt;Production Assistant Tech Manual&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-be-a-great-stagehand-tips-and-tricks&quot;&gt;1. How to Be a Great Stagehand: Tips and Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always arrive 10 minutes early for your call. If your call starts at 9am, that means you start working at 9am. Give yourself enough time to clock on, tool up, and get ready for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to stay busy during your work call. If you have nothing to do, ask your other crew members and supervisor if they need help doing anything. If no one needs help, keep yourself busy by working on something else like tidying backstage or the storage closets, sweeping or mopping the stage, returning tools to their homes, or organizing gels in the catwalks. If you’ve finished cleaning and your co-workers/supervisor still don’t need assistance, either ask for a break or spend the time getting more familiar with systems that you might not yet understand. If someone walks into the space while you are staring at your phone, book or computer, it reflects badly on the entire crew and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appropriate Dress:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Close-toed shoes&lt;br /&gt;
Clothes you can move comfortably in&lt;br /&gt;
Full length pants&lt;br /&gt;
Appropriate tools for the job (flashlight, crescent wrench, etc)&lt;br /&gt;
Long hair is tied back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not wear:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open-toed shoes&lt;br /&gt;
High heels&lt;br /&gt;
Dangly jewelry&lt;br /&gt;
Skirts or dresses&lt;br /&gt;
Torn or dirty clothes (unless it’s a tech day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working a show call and/or will be positioned backstage, wear all black (or as close as you can possibly get) with black/dark soft-soled shoes. NO shorts are allowed. If you’re working at front of house, wear all black OR dark professional clothes: button down shirt, dress pants, nice shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t know how to do something, ask. It’s way better to spend more time on something during setup than to do something incorrectly if you’re unsure; we will all pay for it at showtime. Double/triple check everything you do and point out concerns or inconsistencies to the other crew members and supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to talk to those renting/using the spaces. Consider the implications of user requests before saying yes or no. If these requests are outside of your domain, bring that question to the right person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get access to the greenroom? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we hang a curtain here? I’ll have to ask my Stage Manager or Supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a 2nd wireless mic? I’ll ask the audio engineer for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a spotlight here? I’ll ask the lighting engineer for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a table in the lobby for check in? Yes. Then, go grab a table from 065 and bring it up to the lobby. If you’re short on time, or can’t follow through, reach out to Operations for support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I peek through the stage door while people are in the house? No. Guide them to look at the video monitor at the Stage Manager Console instead (you have control over the camera, so you could scan the audience to get a feel for how crowded the house is). Otherwise, if they need a better view, tell them to sneak out into the lower vestibule and enter at the lower level entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I get a stage picture through the stage door? Tell them to hold while you ask the person in charge of the event to approve this request. Opening the stage door for any reason other than an entrance will distract the audience, but in the end it’s up to the person running the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lightheartedness and laughter are crucial and help us all get through long hours of hard labor, remember that you’re here to work. Try not to goof off too much while on the clock. Socialize after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing something that could potentially affect the entire crew, announce to everyone what you are doing. For example, if you are working in the catwalks or in a genie, shout, “Working overhead!” If you are bringing in a lineset, say, “Lineset moving!” or “U3 flying in!” Before you turn off all the lights off on stage or in the house, you should shout “Going dark!”. Always wait for acknowledgement from others in the space in the form of “Thank you!” before executing the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are patrons or members of the cast on stage or in the house and you need to be working up in the catwalks on lighting, check with your supervisor first. It may be better to wait until the space is empty. However, if time is tight, as it can often be, you may have to work despite others being in the way. Make sure those directly below you have cleared the area before continuing to work over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot make a shift for some reason, text/email other members of the crew to find a replacement. Let your manager know immediately. Your shift is your responsibility, so even if you have other things going on, get sick, injured or realize your have a paper due in the morning, you must find a cover because the show must go on. Be very careful when finding a cover because they must have the same skill set you do in order to do your job. Double check with this person the day before the shift to make sure they are still covering for you. If for some reason they fall through, it falls on you. Even one “incident” could put you into suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical hazards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be smart about lifting heavy objects! If you can’t lift it yourself, ask someone to help. If you are lifting something onto a cart, bring the cart close to the object you are moving. The less carrying, the less strain on your back. As always, lift with your knees, not your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always confirm that lighting or audio equipment is off before plugging or unplugging anything. When using a blade, always cut away from yourself and others; be careful and use common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wear gloves and long sleeves when planning to touch hot lighting fixtures. Always wear shoes while on the deck. The stage floor splinters terribly and nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing the Hall:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When closing the hall, don’t even ask if you can clock out or go home until every single thing is back in its place, stage/backstage/FOH are totally clean, everything is setup for the next event, all the systems are shut down and the three sets of exterior doors (as well as auxiliary doors to the storage closet, instrument storage, and green room) are closed and locked securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door stops:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Always push door stops into the vestibules, not out into the hallways! This is exactly how they grow legs and walk away. Also, push them to the sides of the vestibules so other people walking in don’t trip over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piano safety:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Steinway is a big object on little wheels! Move it slowly and be aware of all hazards AT ALL TIMES. Do not allow it to come close to running into doors, door frames and walls or over items such as cables, curtain, or the little metal thresholds for the door closers. Immediately lock it down after moving it by twisting the pins on the two wheels near the piano keys clockwise until tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have locked down the piano, tri-fold the cover lengthwise, and then roll it up and store it backstage. Next, lift the cover off the piano keys. Then, slide the built in music stand toward the keys and lift it up into place. Ask the the pianist whether they would like the piano lid to be down, at half-stick, or at full-stick. Always double check that the wheels are locked before lifting the lid. The full stick sits in the square hole. The half stick sits in the circular hole. Be extremely careful when handling the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always have at least two people moving the piano; a third is helpful to open doors and move anything that’s in the way. These two people moving the piano, or at least one of them, should be from our team. If you see a group trying to move a piano on their own, please step in and put your hands on that piano until it is in place, the wheels are locked, and everyone has stepped away. Kindly open the lid for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to lock the stage wall panels. If they need to be open at an angle where they cannot lock, sandbag them. Sandbags can be found in the amp room. If you see bags sitting out, put them back in the amp room. Confirm that the panels are locked by pushing them gently once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, double and triple check your work, if necessary, to avoid messing up an entire show. Take your time, ask questions, do it right the first time and you won’t have to be embarrassed when it fails or waste everyone’s time while doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, spike the upstage offstage corners of objects. Spike the piano with L’s on the upstage and offstage sides of the legs. Spike music stands with T’s directly under the vertical of the stand. Have the long line of the T point the direction the stand faces. If you have more than one stage change, color code each setup. You can even write a note to yourself on the spike tape. Use sharpie or pen and keep it simple. If there is going to be a lot of movement/big set changes, it is a good idea to draw up a stage plot of each change and label the page with the appropriate color of spike tape. If marley is down, put a piece of clear tape over each spike to make sure it doesn’t get danced off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Stage right and left:&lt;/u&gt; When speaking stage direction, you always refer to it from the artist’s perspective.  If you are standing on stage, facing the audience, your left is stage left and right is stage right. If you are standing in the audience, or at FOH, and you are calling out stage movement, your left will become “stage right” and your right is “stage left”. Same rule applies to someone standing backstage left and looking onto stage from the wing; away from you should be referred to as “stage right”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;On and off stage:&lt;/u&gt; Sometimes, if you’re standing at a funny angle, up in the genie, or it doesn’t matter which direction you’re going, it may be easier for you to explain yourself using “on stage” and “off stage.”  “Off stage” is always referring to away from the center line and towards the wings in either direction. Moving something “on stage” would mean to move it toward the center line from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flying in and out:&lt;/u&gt; This is how we refer to things that are moving up and down. Battens and banners fly in when they are moving down from the ceiling and they fly out when moving back up toward the ceiling. Always call out, in your loudest speaking voice, to the whole room when you are flying battens in or out. Example: Batten 2 flying out! Or lineset 6 flying in! The response should be: Thank you flying in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Terminology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Apron:&lt;/u&gt; The portion of the stage that is downstage of the proscenium arch. (Since we don’t have a built in proscenium in the hall, we consider the apron to be everything downstage of the ‘plaster line’.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Batten:&lt;/u&gt; Part of a fly system. A horizontal pipe, supported by lift lines, electrical hoists (ours are drum winch) &amp;amp; motors (variable speed), which is easily raised and lowered; even while holding a substantial amount of weight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Blackout:&lt;/u&gt; Removing all light from the stage, often for a set change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Boom:&lt;/u&gt; A boom is a vertical pipe standing anywhere onstage where lighting units are hung on stage, usually in the wings. They are usually screwed into 50lb boom bases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Catwalks:&lt;/u&gt; A catwalk is a section of the house hidden in the ceiling from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Center Line:&lt;/u&gt; A special type of line drawn on a Ground Plan, located at the plane which bisects the stage left and stage right sides of the theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Crossover:&lt;/u&gt; The upstage place behind any stage curtains or scenery, which allows performers to get from one side of the stage to the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cue:&lt;/u&gt; Any moment in the course of a performance where there is a change in the physical state. In the case of sound, a cue might start music playing, and then a subsequent cue might lower the volume as an actor starts to speak, and yet another might fade the music to silence when the scene comes to an end. Cues are most often associated with lighting and sound (any given show quite often has hundreds of light and sound cues), but cues are also established when scenery needs to change, line sets need to fly, effects need to be triggered, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dimmer room:&lt;/u&gt; The room which contains the dimmer racks which power the lighting rig in the theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Electric:&lt;/u&gt; An electric is a horizontal pipe hanging upstage of the proscenium (usually part of the fly system), often with lighting circuits connected to it, where lighting units are hung in a theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Fly System:&lt;/u&gt; A series of pulleys, ropes, wires, and/or other apparatus which collectively allows the hanging and vertical movement of curtains, lighting instruments, scenery, and even people. (Our fly system is motorized electrical drum winch hoists and controlled through the automated rigging system.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Grand Curtain (or Main Curtain):&lt;/u&gt; The curtain that closes just upstage of the proscenium arch. Generally speaking, opening the grand curtain signifies the start of the show or act and closing it signifies the end of the act or show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;House:&lt;/u&gt; The place where the audience sits to watch the performance. Also the place where lighting instruments hang when they’re hanging over the audience. Front-of-House can refer to the lobby or other non-performance space where audience members congregate before and after the show and during intermission. (Just to confuse things, Audio Engineers also refer to front-of-house, or FOH, as their house mix position in order to differentiate themselves from the the monitor engineer on stage.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Masking:&lt;/u&gt; As a noun, anything which hides something from the audience. As a verb, the act of hiding things from the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Plaster Line:&lt;/u&gt; An imaginary reference line on stage that indicates where the proscenium arch is. (Our plaster line runs stage left to right from about the point where the stage starts to curve on the downstage lip.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Proscenium Arch:&lt;/u&gt; The viewing portal or frame through which the audience sees the performance. (Our Proscenium Arch is theoretical except for when the grand curtain and border are hanging on U1 and U2.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Shell:&lt;/u&gt; A hard, often movable surface, designed to reflect sound into the audience for musical performances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Sight lines:&lt;/u&gt; Imaginary lines indicating the view from the extreme-most seats. If someone or something is said to be in sight lines, it means that they are visible to all audience members regardless of seating choice. If someone or something is described as out of sightlines, it means that no audience members are able to see them. A good rule of thumb for sightlines is “if you can see them, they can see you.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Soft Goods:&lt;/u&gt; Curtains that are used onstage. This can include the “Blacks,” “Cyc,” “Grand Curtain,” and “Scrims,” among other things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Spike:&lt;/u&gt; Marking the stage floor with an indicator showing the location of a set piece or where a performer should stand. Spike marks are usually made on the upstage corners of a prop with small pieces of spike tape to show the direction it should be facing and also color coded by set transition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Stage/Deck:&lt;/u&gt; The primary playing space surrounded by the apron, wings, and fly space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Strike:&lt;/u&gt; Strike can be referred to as temporarily taking something away (e.g. “During the scene change, you strike the phone.”).  It can also be used at the end of a run to specify that everything should be disassembled, put away and cleaned in order to have a fresh canvas for the next group coming in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Trim:&lt;/u&gt; The height that a batten or any other object hangs at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Wings:&lt;/u&gt; Areas that are part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are typically masked with legs. The wing space is used for performers preparing to enter, storage of sets for scenery changes and as a stagehand work area. Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the fly system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marley-a-guide-to-laying-a-dance-floor&quot;&gt;2. Marley: A Guide to Laying a Dance Floor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marley is a type of dance floor. It allows dancers to move easily across the deck and offers more give, resulting in higher and more efficient jumps. Marley comes in heavy vinyl strips. These strips are about four feet wide and span the length of the stage. To both lay out and strike marley, you need at least two people. Ideally, you have a crew of four: two to tape down a strip while the other two prep the next strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s marley is stored on pieces of white PVC pipe backstage right. When the flooring is down, the empty rolls can live backstage left, preferably upstage and out of the way. To lay the marley you’ll start offstage right. When rolling it back up you’ll start offstage left. The bottom of the marley will be on the outside of the roll; make sure the correct side is face up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before marley is laid out, the stage should be swept thoroughly. The Performance Hall’s marley is cut into seven panels (1 = upstage, 7 = downstage apron). Each is labeled. If for some reason you can’t find the label, relabel it using gaff tape and a sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay a marley floor you will need: marley tape, scissors/a blade, at least one buddy, knee pads (optional). While Marley tape is black like gaff tape, it is smooth and shiny in texture. Do not use gaff tape on the marley; it will leave behind a residue. When you need to cut marley tape, use scissors or a blade. Don’t try to tear the marley tape, it’s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both laying and striking the marley, the wings stage left and right should be open. The marley will lie underneath them. Be careful when sliding the marley under each panel; go too far and you’ll hit a hinge and need to readjust. Try not to cover any of the panel locking drop holes so you can still lock them into place if needed. Be aware that the Performance Hall’s stage is trapezoidal. The upstage wall is shorter than the downstage edge and the marley is cut to match this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laying Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Beginning the process:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, move the roll #6 of marley to the stage right, downstage corner. The rolls are very heavy, so be careful and work in a team when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best way to move the marley is to slowly walk the roll over on its end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the marley onto the floor so the longer edge is downstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the pieces of tape holding the roll together. If any tape goo is left on the marley, clean it before laying it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the marley fully by pushing the roll across the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the PVC pipes in the backstage left corner, upstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, align the edges of the marley with off stage walls. Once it’s even on both sides and kissing the lip, park it and tape it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are no bubbles, tape the stage left and right sides down first. Use three pieces of tape running off stage (one upstage, one downstage and one center) to anchor both sides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are bubbles, tape one side down and have one person kneel on that edge to hold it in place. Have a second person on the other edge pulling toward themselves and a third person stomp across toward the second person. Once the third person has crossed the stage, the second person will tape their edge down before the third person steps off the marley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Taping lengthwise:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start offstage right and work your way stage left as a team (or vice versa).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will hold the tape down while the Tech B creates a long stretch of slack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before touching the tape down, Tech B will stretch it taut and carefully hold it over the seam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will then smoothly press the tape onto the ground (moving toward Tech B) and check for any irregularity along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue this process across the length of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Techs A and B are taping Panel 6, Techs C and D should be prepping the next panel, laying the rest of the panels out in order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When securing section #7, tape slowly and try to follow the curve of the lip smoothly. If you must fold tape over the stage edge, do so, but do it neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have irregularity, fix the issue before moving on. Irregularity can create dangerous situations for dancers who are unaware of the problem. Here are some situations you would fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the marley is overlapping under the tape, either press it out or lift up and start again. A small gap between panels is better than overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a bubble in the marley itself, stomp it out in the direction you’re taping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your roll runs out of tape, cut that edge straight, tape it down and grab a new roll. Line up the new piece of tape carefully to ensure clean overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just laid your own dance floor! Only one more thing to do before you take a break: dry sweep and mop the marley flooring. Use a bit of the Roscoe Marley Floor Cleaner in your bucket of water but nothing else. If an outside stage manager wants to use something else, ask your supervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every rehearsal or performance on marley, the stage must be swept and then mopped. Mop in smooth figure eights across the stage pulling the dirt toward you and not pushing it out away from you. Clean one strip at a time. When you’ve pulled all the dirt to one end of the stage, use the mop to pick up the dirt and deposit it into the water bucket. Do not walk on the marley until it is dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using marley alongside soft goods, always roll marley out first. When you need to sweep and mop the marley while soft goods are in, fly the goods out about a foot. This will allow you to clean the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking the Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Striking marley is far easier than laying it. If there are soft goods hanging that touch the floor, sweep the stage and strike the soft goods first. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sweep and mop one last time. Wait for the marley to dry. DO NOT roll the marley up if it is wet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove all of your tape. (Make a giant tape ball, if you’d like! Play with it, name it, take it home, and shower it with unconditional love. Don’t shower with it.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your PVC pipes. Always roll panels stage left to stage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting downstage left (Strip #7), tape the edge of the marley to your PVC pipe at three points; top, center and bottom (Strips #7 and #6 have unique edges that will only need one or two strips of tape to anchor them to the PVC pipe).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are taping the marley to the pipe in a way that will allow you to roll the marley in a straight line the entire length of the floor.  One side should always be flush with the pipe edge but not overextending over the end of the pipe edge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you find that you have lost sight of the pipe on your straight edge, unroll and start over.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you get to the end, make sure you still have the one exposed PVC pipe edge you’ve been working hard to maintain throughout the length of the roll.  This is the side the marley will stand on when stored upright.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it looks good and your edge is straight, you’re ready to tape the rolled up marley to itself (again top, center, and bottom).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double check that it has not lost its label. If it has, make a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand the rolled up marley in its home backstage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DO NOT store upright unsupported by the PVC pipe with the weight on the edge of the flooring itself. This will cause the ends to bend and crease in ways that will damage the marley long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-guide-to-the-performance-halls-soft-goods&quot;&gt;3. A Guide to the Performance Hall’s Soft Goods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people refer to as “curtains” are actually called “soft goods” within the technical theater community. As opposed to “hard goods,” soft goods have the capability to fold. These goods include items such as legs, borders, scrims, full stage blacks, and grand curtains (also referred to as main curtain). The Performance Hall at the University of Chicago has all of these. This section guides you through identifying, hanging, folding, and handling these various soft goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every soft good’s basic components are in relation to how it hangs on stage. A good’s top, bottom, back and front are easily identifiable even when folded. When one of these goods is set up on stage, the top refers to the end near the ceiling, the bottom to the end at the floor, the front refers to the side facing the audience, the back is the side the audience can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the top of the good is a row of lengths of tie line. These tie lines are used to attach it to the pipe. When tying these lines to a batten, use a knot like tying your shoes. First, tie a simple half hitch, or what is commonly known as a single knot. Then, finish with a bow. Never tie a double knot. The ties on every good are all black except for one white tie; the white tie is your center tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hanging a soft good, first determine if it requires fullness or tautness (a loose or a tight look). Our borders and legs usually require fullness whereas our scrim and the full stage black need to be hung taut. Knots should be tight against the batten pipe unless instructed otherwise.  Never hang soft goods on a batten where they will be in direct contact with lights. This is a fire hazard. Talk to your supervisor and the visiting production team to determine a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top of the good is a handwritten label, naming the good and giving specifications related to the size of the good. When taking down and folding it, the label must always end up on the outside of the roll so future stagehands can easily identify it. You’ll notice only the Legs and Film Screen Masking curtains have chain at the bottom. The purpose of this chain is to stretch the good down to the stage and keep it from moving if touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always have a buddy or two helping when folding soft goods. It is possible to fold solo, but it is very, very hard. Before flying-in any soft good, first &lt;strong&gt;clear the deck&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sweep the floor&lt;/strong&gt;! We want to keep our curtains looking tidy for a number of good reasons. Never walk on any of the soft goods with shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying-in any batten, pull together a ground crew to watch the pipe from stage level. While watching the pipe for possible collisions, your ground crew should also do an initial rough accordion folding of the curtain, making sure the front velour doesn’t accidentally fall forward onto the floor. Do not pull it too hard on the curtains as you fold them; you do not want to put too much stress on the rigging or move the pipe much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the batten has stopped moving, untie the goods and fly the pipe out again so there is nothing in the way while folding. Before you start moving the curtain around and spreading it out to fold, make sure all of the front is always face up and the back is face down. The back is a rougher texture than the velvety front, so it’s easy to tell the difference. It is important that the good rolls only on its back, so as to “save face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay the first curtain out flat onstage. Each good is folded differently, so have a clear plan on how you will fold each one before you do. Most of our curtains are folded bottom to top (as many times as needed) then rolled from one side to the other, as to fit into the bin, with the &lt;strong&gt;information label facing out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folding (with your buddy) run one side’s corners to the other side’s corner trying to catch air in between the top and bottom sections. Capturing air also makes folding easier, resulting in less drag and allows you a few moments to fix problem areas with ease. Have a third person catching and realigning the center lines as they will be the biggest problems. Always remember to make sure your lines are even and edges match. Do not forget about the bottom half just because you can’t see it anymore! Each piece should be flat and even. If your fold has overshot the bottom edge, redo the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Legs are used to create wings. They come in pairs, one hung with fullness on each side of the stage on the same batten. The Performance Hall has four sets of legs. Keep each leg with its buddy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior to hanging legs, determine whether you need pipe extensions in each end of the batten.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also, determine how far onstage the legs are needed for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First tie the onstage and offstage ties where you want them, then tie the center tie line. Now you have 2 identical sections that need their centers tied. Once those are tied, you will have 4 sections that need their centers tied. Continue to tie 50% marks until all ties are evenly spaced and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flying the batten out, the person running the rigging console is responsible for gathering a ground crew and ensuring that nothing crashes into the architecture. The ground crew (of at least 2 people) is responsible for watching the pipe and attachments, as well as physically unfolding the legs as they fly. ALWAYS have eyes on both ends of the batten as you fly it out so that you don’t damage the walls, ceiling, the battens or other people on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are dirty, stop flying them out and clean them as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person at scene control must stop the batten before it reaches its upper limit where it sits in its ceiling pocket. With the extensions in, it will not fit; it must sit below its home. Again, ALWAYS watch the batten as you raise it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the legs far enough out so their bottoms sit just barely on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk up to FOH to double check that they are evenly placed on stage. If they’re not perfectly even or end up covering the speakers, redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the leg out the length of the stage, front side face up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legs are folded over twice (side to side), and then rolled bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once laid out, check where the label is on the top section. This side will remain on the floor as you fold toward it so it is on the outside when you put the leg away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one edge starts to cone inwards while the other cones out, unroll and reroll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware at this point that one side of the good may be thicker than the other. The thicker side should be kept as tight as possible. The other should loosen just enough to keep it even.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the rolled leg into the bin using the help of gravity. Tipping the bin and rolling the good inside will usually be harder than picking the good up and dropping it inside, but can be done if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Borders are used with legs to complete the proscenium look. They are also used to hide other things hanging in the air, such as lights &amp;amp; other things in the air. They run the width of the stage, but only hang down a few feet from the ceiling. Our borders are also used as a skirt to mask the bottom of the film screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s borders are stored in the same bins as the legs. Borders would normally be hung 1 pipe downstage of a set of legs, but because our space was designed with some oddities, there’s really only one good place to hang a border and that’s U3. U3 is special because it does not interfere with the lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as with the legs, use the 50% rule when tying the border to the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the batten out all the way, always keeping eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The border itself is much longer than the width of the stage, so open the downstage panels to allow yourself more room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lay the border out so the center is farther offstage and prepare the first half by spreading it out and laying the onstage side flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold this edge to the center line evenly and then pull the border across the stage to give yourself room to repeat the process with the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flatten out the unfolded side and fold to the center line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that you have the whole thing fitting on stage, fold the bottom to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s impossible to keep the label on the outside of a border, since we’ve brought both ends to the center, so just keep track of which one you’re working with before rolling and binning it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borders aren’t as easy to lift, but they’re still liftable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Stage Black (FSB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The full stage black is usually used to cover the upstage wall or to cut the depth of stage in half. In the Performance Hall, it can be hung from U3, U4, U6 and D-Light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the full stage black on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting at center and working offstage, tie every other tie until you reach the end of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back at center, pull your knots away from the center, pulling the fabric taut in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop when the bottom of the FSB rests on the deck of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold the good bottom to top, making sure to catch lots of air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this twice with the new bottom edge you have created, folding the good a total of three times, always bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the good so the label stays on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the hamper over and set it on it’s side, roll the good inside, and carefully tip it back up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will need another person to do this, the hamper will now be very heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrims (white and black)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Performance Hall has two scrims, a black scrim and a white scrim. They are stored in the same bin upstage but inside canvas bags to keep them from pilling on each other.  Unlike the other soft goods in the Performance Hall, scrims are used aesthetically, to both bounce and transmit light. They are often used in dance pieces, alongside a ground row of strip or cyc lights.  They are sometimes used as an alternate upstage projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the scrims are so light, they will need to be bottom-piped once they’re flown out. Bottom pipe can be found in the storage room across from the greenroom. They are the lightweight aluminum pipes that fit together, end to end. When bottom-piping the scrim, &lt;strong&gt;make sure the pipe sits in the inner nylon pocket, not the outer fabric pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrims are hung and folded in the same manner as the full stage black. When hanging, start in the center and work your way off stage then go back and pull tautness into the fabric. When folding, fold bottom to top 3 times before rolling toward the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hampers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All of the Performance Hall’s soft goods are stored in hampers that live along the upstage wall backstage. Each hamper is labelled according to its contents. The hampers are only just small enough to pass through the upstage corridor and downstage doors to the stage. Be careful when moving them, as their hinges may catch on the architecture. For extra precaution, open panels to get the bins onstage. Determine whether you need to lay the bin on its side before loading or unloading goods. If you do, lay it down with its open lid on the floor. Be aware of the locks! Be extremely careful to not scratch the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;genie-use--safety&quot;&gt;4. Genie Use &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To use the genie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projection-crestron--amx&quot;&gt;5. Projection: Crestron &amp;amp; AMX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different systems/methods to connect video content to the digital projector, Crestron and AMX. You have to understand the signal flow of each system before deciding which one to use. There are only 2 inputs to the AMX system outside the projection booth, both located at the FOH desk. Crestron, on the other hand, has system at 6 different inputs around the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important to note that the AMX system sends it’s audio out of the line array whereas the Crestron system sends to the EVs, aka “the mains”. Obviously, you’ll want to make sure that you have the correct speaker system flown into the space when you plug into the projector or your audio content will be muffled, distant and reverberant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crestron System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crestron&lt;/strong&gt; is a control system that allows us to control multiple audio-visual devices from a single interface. In the Performance Hall, we have two Crestron touch screens: at FOH and the Stage Manager Console. We use Crestron to connect audio and video from and to various places throughout the space. Be aware that the Stage Manager Console touch screen has some advanced features that the FOH one does not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to connect properly, you must understand all the inputs and outputs of the system. Inputs include Crestron labeled HDMI, VGA, ⅛” and RCA jacks (found in AVPs and floor boxes). Outputs include the digital projector, LCD screens in the upper and lower Gidwitz lobbies and the viewing monitor at the Stage Manager console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The master volume control is at the bottom/center of each touchscreen. Be mindful of where your master volume level is set when testing; always start quiet and increase as needed. Each volume control also has it’s own mute button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose the “Volume” button at the bottom right corner for more options. The first tab of the Volume page will give you your Presentation Source volume as well as the 3 RCA connections found in downstage floor boxes. The second tab of the Volume page will give you volume control for all 6 Utility mics (“U” inputs as opposed to “M” inputs) also found in the same downstage floor boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding “Sources” and “Destinations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The function of routing inputs and outputs is only available at the Stage Manager Console. From the Presentation Sources tab, choose the technician mode button at the bottom right corner and enter the password: 5540. You will then be brought to a deeper routing section that is divided into two sections: Source and Destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sources are all inputs to the system; the HDMI or VGA inputs on stage, FOH and the Stage Manager Console as well as the Auditorium camera and the BluRay player in the Stage Manager Console rack. The Destinations are all the outputs to the system; the Auditorium Projector (which is the digital projector in the Projection Booth), the Stage Manager Monitor, and the LCD screens in the lobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to “soft patch” the connection, first select the “Source” then the “Destination” simply by pressing the buttons on screen.  Once connected, the source name will show up in the box just below the destination.  When soft patching, take a quick glance at all the other patches connected and make sure you still want those connections live - deactivate if not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Signal to the Lobby TV screens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using the primary Crestron touchscreen, press the Technician button and enter the password: 5540. Once you’re in, select the Source you’ve plugged into, then choose the Destinations labeled “LCD Auditorium” and “LCD LL Lobby” (lower level lobby). Next, go out and manually switch over the inputs on the screens by pressing the “input” button at the bottom of the TV until you reach the HDMI input holding your content.  At the end of the night, switch it back to the digital signage reel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Video to the Projector through Crestron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you connect through Crestron, make sure you choose the correct input on the Crestron touch screen under Presentation Sources. There are 3 inputs on the stage (“Down Stage Left, Center and Right”), one at FOH (called the “In House Mix Input”), one at the Stage Manager Console (“Stage Mgr Input”), and one in the Projection Booth (“Control Booth Input”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your device connected and soft patched to Crestron, turn the projector on using the AMX touch screen at FOH. Choose “Turn On System and Projector” and enjoy a moment of zen while waiting approximately 1 minute before the systems turns on. Once the system is on, tell AMX to “talk” to Crestron, by going to the ‘Sources’ tab, selecting ‘Crestron’, then pressing ‘Go Live’. After a few seconds, the connected source should display on the Projector Screen (or the back wall). Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Video to the Projector through AMX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you use the Mac Mini at FOH to bring up your projection content, you’ll be connecting directly to the AMX system through DVI-1. There is also a DVI-2 cable floating around on the control desk for laptop connection. Remember, if you are connecting through DVI to the AMX system, you need to have the line array in the system. Do not connect to the AMX system directly if you do not have an audio engineer on hand, you won’t have audio without their help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your content on the Mac Mini conrol display, your audio engineer at your side, and the AMX system is powered on, take your video content and drag it over to the Lillyput display to the left of the main display. On the AMX touch screen, choose “Sources”, DVI-1, “Go Live” and within a few seconds you should see your content on the back wall or projection screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning off the Projector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lamp on the digital projector is a beast; it runs at around 38,000 lumens. It’s expensive as hell and only lasts about 600 hours total. When you’re using projection, remember to turn it off when you’re not planning on using it for a while. To do this, on the AMX touch screen, choose Utility, then System &amp;amp; Projector Off. Confirm again that you want to shut down and it will begin it’s 4 minute cooling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-a-show-your-duties&quot;&gt;6. Working a Show: Your Duties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always check the &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; to see what company you’ll be working with for your shift. If you’re lucky, the visiting artists have been responsive, thought ahead, and had the foresight to fully plan out their performance details.  If so, a basic rundown of what needs to be done will be in the calendar notes section. Make a mental note of these tasks and be prepared to accomplish all. Ask questions ahead of time if you have any, such as “Do we need to check out any gear from the cage?” or “What time is the talent arriving?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clocking in and out&lt;/strong&gt; is important; don’t mess this part up or HR will start to dislike you as a person. They are the ones that write your checks, so seriously, don’t mess this part up. It’s your responsibility to remember to do this. If for some reason you forgot to clock in or out at the right time, immediately send an email to Erin detailing the time/date that you did clock in/out vs the time/date that you were supposed to clock in/out.  Words like “today”, “yesterday” and “last Monday” don’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the Stagehand Tips and Tricks, you should dress appropriately to each crew call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as an event on the “Performance” calendar, do not fail to dress the part.  If you are normally backstage, you must wear black head to toe. If you know you will be sitting at front of house, you can either wear all blacks or professional clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as something on the “Rehearsal” calendar, feel free to relax those standards a bit.  If nothing else is scheduled coinciding with your shift, you can expect tech work and should wear more comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you complete your tasks quickly and see others still working, go lend them a hand. This is not a union house–you can cross between departments. Whoever you may be, meet up with the rest of the crew or the members of a visiting production team. Understand what is expected of you throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the show, even if you do not have anything to do for a while, do not busy yourself with homework, reading, or facebook. Your actions distract audience members and artists while you end up looking lazy to the other professionals. Watch and pay attention to the show. You never know what is going to happen on stage and if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss your cue. If you cannot spare four or six hours to work a show, then you should not take the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be extra quiet while a performance is taking place.  The hall was designed with acoustics in mind. Someone speaking at a normal volume on stage can be heard throughout the entire room.  Remember this when talking through clear com at the FOH position, especially during quieter parts of the show. With a headset on, what might seem like a whisper to you can be heard by everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you need to walk away from your post for a moment, let the rest of the crew know by saying, “[your name] going off headset.” Give the other crew members a second to respond in case they have something important to say before you go. When you return, let them know you’re back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, always act professionally. Your actions reflect the entire crew, your bosses, the venue and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Out of all the members of the crew on the show call, congratulations, you have the most duties. You are the liaison between the crew and the performers. All stage management duties follow a logic of making a show run smoothly. Communicate with your crew and the visiting production team and you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, go up to Erin’s office and get the stage management keys. Keep them on you for the rest of the night. Don’t forget to return them at the end of the night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the space, propping open backstage doors and the green room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock the backstage cabinet.  Make sure it stays closed throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Scene Control, the stage manager console, and the amp room sequencer (plus sub amp).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your backstage monitor at the stage manager console. Make sure that there are no banners in the way and that the camera is in focus so you can see the stage. If you can’t see anything on your monitor, check in with your supervisor or other crew members. They can help you fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the board operators and visiting production team. While the board ops are in charge of discussing their specific needs, you should have a general grasp of what is happening on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find out if the group has any digital materials. While digital files for projection or audio playback should be handed over to your board ops, digital signage for the lobby LCD screens will be inserted by you at the Stage Manager console. (More on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternately, you can send the live camera feed to the lobby monitors after rehearsals are finished, once the stage has cleared and house is open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a copy of the program. If there is none, speak with someone from the team and build one out. Take notes on entrances, exits, and cues (both light and sound). Some groups will provide their own cue sheet. Determine the entire show flow:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time is the show supposed to start?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time should the doors open to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there an intermission? If so, for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When is the show scheduled to end?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who will be walking onto stage, when and from where? Do they need mics?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your clearcom backstage. Your headset, pack, and cable are in the drawer in the stage management console. Spares are in the upstage right cabinet.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do a clearcom check with your board operators. Have them go on headset. Check if you can hear one another, your volumes are set properly and your call buttons work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right after doors are open, put the DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR sign on the back of the downstage left door. From this point on, YOU are the only person allowed to open this door. DO NOT let anyone (even Bill or Obama) run past you onto stage without clearing it with lighting and sound first. FOH relies on you heavily to start the show only after they are ready. Own this door, it’s yours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk over to the green room and inform performers that the house is now open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five minutes prior to show, give a 5 minute warning to members of the cast and crew. If performers request more time, let your house staff know if they need to hold doors or if the show will start late.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your first performers backstage. Keep them backstage and ready to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the show is ready to start, tell your friends at FOH to begin the process of house lights to half. This will notify the audience to take their seats and prepare for the start of the show. Allow one minute for everyone to get settled and then request the lighting operator to bring the house lights all the way out and into the first lighting look - usually stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for confirmation that the light change is in progress and send out your performers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the performers are out, close the inner vestibule doors as to isolate sound from the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.  Cross out movements/acts as they finish to stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the backstage left monitor for stage movement. Be ready and open the door if someone is walking offstage.  Make sure you actually open the door before they get close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If handing out wireless microphones, remember to check that they are on/have full battery strength before handing them out. Confirm with your sound board op as to which mic you’ve given out. Make sure you get the mic back when the person exits stage, turn it off if it won’t be in use again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are nervous the person using the mic will accidentally turn it off during their performance, or if the sound board operator has requested it, put a sleeve on the microphone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help nervous actors, musicians and other talent by being a calming force. Exude confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are the backstage point person throughout the entire show, help talent with anything they need - water, towel, safety pin, costume change, even a bucket to puke in (use a lined garbage can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return your ClearCom &amp;amp; cable to its drawer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help other strike what needs to be struck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the hall usable for the next day’s crew. For example, if you used the piano but the next crew will not, return it to instrument storage. If you didn’t use the piano but they will, bring it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up and throw away any garbage or show specific paperwork. Empty the trash bin backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to return any personal items left behind.  If the group is long gone, leave these items with the lost and found at the North Desk and tell the building manager on duty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everyone has cleared out, make sure all 3 entrances are closed and locked, as well as the green room entrances, storage closets, and stage door.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you turned on scene control, turn it off and reconnect its key with the stage manager key set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IMPORTANT: DO NOT FORGET to return the stage manager key set to Erin’s office. The next morning’s crew will not be able to do anything without this key set and will have to hunt you down. Public shaming will ensue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, logistical mishaps, or mischievous deviants, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report instead if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Board Operator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue * Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take notes on lighting cues needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure EP LOCKOUT is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with the stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound Board Operator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover and turn on the Venue SC48; store the cover under the console.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the sequencer (the key in the upper section of the left rack in the patchbay). Also, turn on the sub amp (the lower right hand section of the rack) by pressing the on button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with visiting artists their music, video, and whether they need any equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your archival recording and test that it is getting level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always set up a backup wireless mic on a straight stand off stage left (in a place where the audience won’t see them every time the stage door opens) to easily deal with any last minute mic requests.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the batteries are fresh if you are about to go into a show.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use half-life batteries if you are in a rehearsal.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Throw dead batteries into the dead battery bin.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microphones:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Set up requested microphones backstage and/or onstage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fly speakers in to the appropriate height based on the type of performance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fly in the banners if there will be amplified music or speaking.  Make sure you do not fly banners in front of the stage camera or the projection window if projection will be in use.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If using wireless mics, check all batteries and consider sleeving the mics.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Patch microphones in the patch bay from your “M” inputs on stage to the Venue by using the TRS cables hanging in the amp room (the red, green, and black cords).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitors:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Always set up monitors if someone will be singing through a microphone on stage.  Often, instrumental groups with multiple mics will want monitors in order to hear each other better.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Patch monitors in the speakon patchbay, from Venue outputs to stage inputs, using the short CROSSWIRED speakon cables found in the amp room only. DO NOT use regular speakon cable - they are wired differently and can damage the gear.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soundcheck:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Before the band arrives, if possible, do a line check to make sure that each microphone and monitor is passing signal.  To line check, have your audio assistant speak into each mic, one at a time, in order to pre-set general gains. Deal with phantom needs and troubleshoot any patching issues.  Next, have your assistant stand near each monitor while you send signal, one at a time, to confirm the monitors are patched correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is good practice to ring out the monitors before the artists arrive as well.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once the band arrives, start sound checking each mic, focusing on one instrument at a time. If you are checking drums, have the drummer go through his whole kit, one drum/cymbal at a time, while you work with the EQ, comp, gate, etc for each one.  After you have them all dialed in, ask him/her to play the whole set so that you can further tweak (pan, groups, hi-pass, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the musician is hearing the right amount of everything through their monitor; don’t move on to the next musician until each person is happy. If they specifically ask for “everything” it’s important that you don’t give them everything.  In this situation, only give them the most important aspects for clarity’s sake (themselves, vocals, kick drum, lead guitar, whatever that might be).  If you give them everything, they’ll need more of everything and it will become a huge mess.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are mixing a digital instrument such as keyboard, dj rig or sampler, ask them to reproduce their loudest patch so that you can set your gain to that level.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you finish with the last musician and everyone seems happy with their rough mixes, ask the whole group to play a half song together while you walk the room to hear the mix from different listening perspectives - tweak issues accordingly.  When the group stops playing, they will have many requests, deal with each request, one at a time.  Once everyone seems happy, ask them to try a different half song and repeat the whole process until they are happy with the stage mix and you are happy with the house mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure audio cables (only cables that will stay in place for the whole show) are taped down when in high traffic walk ways - brown gaff tape onstage, black offstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there will be any videographers in house and whether or not they need a board feed. Set that up for them ahead of time.  If the videographer shows up after doors are open, you will not be able to send them a feed down to the lower level.  They will have to record from the upper level next to FOH. Make sure their power cables do not run across the house walkways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are tasked with recording the performance, remember to PRESS RECORD(!!) in the minutes leading up to the start of the show. Make sure the device is actually recording and picking up signal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program, and any notes you’ve taken, to make sure you turn the correct mic on each time someone is about to speak and then mute it when they travel off stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with the stage manager, especially when mics are coming on and off the stage throughout the show so you know which mics to take live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use good judgment when deciding whose mics to mute during panels and Q&amp;amp;A’s. Sometime panelists will make a lot of noise when they aren’t speaking, so it might be good to mute their mics if someone else is speaking for a long period of time. To do this well, you will have to have all your fingers on the mutes or faders ready to pull the trigger before they decide to speak up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use your headphones to solo channels in order to find any problem areas that you notice now but didn’t notice during soundcheck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave your ClearCom in a visible place so that you can see calls coming in. The stage manager may need to reach you to communicate, and without that visual you may never know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mute the audio console and head down to stage to begin strike. Play some quiet music if you’d like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before doing anything, attempt to troubleshoot any issues you realized during the show. Test suspect mics, cables, patches, systems, channels, etc before striking. Immediately, send an email to Erin about the problem, when it happened, how you dealt with it and the current status.  Leave the broken gear up in #243 on the secondary desk in Erin’s office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strike all mics, monitors, stands and cable and restore them to their default “home” positions. Remember to keep mic clips with their mic and mic bag, not with the stand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull up all your tape from the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you made an archival recording:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  * Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stagehand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assistance with costume changes
Other duties include:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping other crew members with their set-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a program and take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls. Don’t pay attention to your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During your scene changes:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move quickly and with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike and clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we’re not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/D Converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Analog to digital converter, a device that transforms incoming analog signals into digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for After Fade Listen, another way of saying post-fader solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Send:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer bus output designed to send a signal to an auxiliary processor or monitor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer input with limited control capabilities, intended for bringing the output of an auxiliary processor or other line-level source into the main mix bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Input:&lt;/strong&gt; An input consists of two leads, neither of which is common to the circuit ground. This is a “differential pair”, where the signal consists of the difference in voltage between the two leads. Balanced input circuits can offer excellent rejection of common-mode noise induced into the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Output:&lt;/strong&gt; In a classic balanced audio circuit, the output is carried on two leads (high/+ and low/-) which are isolated from the circuit ground by exactly the same impedance. A symmetrical balanced output carries the same signal at exactly the same level but of opposite polarity with respect to ground. A special case of a balanced output carries the signal on only one lead, with the other lead being at zero voltage with respect to ground, but at the same impedance as the signal-carrying lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;: The band of frequencies that pass through a device with a loss of less than 3dB, expressed in Hertz or in musical octaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardioid:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart-shaped. In sound work, cardioid refers to the shape of the sensitivity vs. direction plot for a particular style of directional microphone. A cardioid mic rejects sound arriving from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel:&lt;/strong&gt; A functional path in an audio circuit: an input channel, an output channel, a recording channel, the left channel and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel strip:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical realization of an audio channel on the front panel of a mixer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipping:&lt;/strong&gt; A form of severe audio distortion that results from peaks of the audio signal attempting to rise above the capabilities of the amplifier circuit. To avoid clipping, reduce the system gain in or before the gain stage in which the clipping occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressor:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a dynamic processor used to smooth out any large transient peaks in an audio signal that might otherwise overload your system or cause distortion. The amplitude threshold and other parameters such as attack time, release time, and ratio are adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condenser:&lt;/strong&gt; Condenser microphones require electrical power to run internal amplifiers and maintain an electrical charge on the capacitor. They are typically powered by internal batteries or “phantom power” supplied by an external source, such as a mixing console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cueing:&lt;/strong&gt; In broadcast, stage and post-production work, to “cue up” a sound or video source (a record, a sound effect on a CD, a song on a tape) means to get it ready for playback by making sure you are in the right position on the “cue,” making sure the level and EQ are all set properly. This requires a special monitoring circuit that only the mixing engineer hears. It does not go out on the air or to the main mixing buses. Cueing can also refer to a similar process regarding video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D/A converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital-to-analog converter, a device that transforms incoming digital signal into analog form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decibel (dB):&lt;/strong&gt; A unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound work, delay usually refers to an electronic circuit or effects unit whose purpose it is to delay the audio signal for some short period of time. Delay can refer to one short repeat, a series of repeats or the complex interactions of delay used in chorusing or reverb. When delayed signals are mixed back with the original sound, a great number of audio effects can be generated, including phasing and flanging, doubling, Haas precedence-effect panning, slap or slapback, echo, regenerative echo, chorusing and hall-like reverberation. Signal time delay is central to many audio effects units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually means without reverberation, or without some other applied effect like delay or chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic microphone:&lt;/strong&gt; The class of microphones that generate electrical signals by the movement of a coil in a magnetic field. Dynamic microphones are rugged, relatively inexpensive, capable of very good performance and do not require external power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equalization (EQ):&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to purposefully changing the frequency response of a circuit, sometimes to correct for previous unequal response (hence the term, equalization), and more often to boost or cut the level at certain frequencies for sound enhancement, to remove extraneous sounds, or to create completely new and different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of times an event repeats itself in a given period of time. The audio frequency range is generally considered to be 20 Hz to 20, 000 Hz. This covers the fundamental pitch and most overtones of musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; The measure of how much a circuit amplifies a signal. Gain may be stated as a ratio of input to output voltage, current or power, such as a voltage gain of 4, or a power gain of 1.5, or it can be expressed in decibels, such as a line amplifier with a gain of 10dB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate:&lt;/strong&gt; A dynamics processor that automatically turns off an input signal when it drops below a certain level. This can reduce the overall noise level of your mix by turning off inputs when they are not in use. Threshold, attack time, hold, and release time are some of the adjustable gate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A graphic equalizer uses slide pots for its boost/cut controls, with its operating frequencies evenly spaced through the audio spectrum. In a perfect world, a line drawn through the centers of thecontrol shafts would form a graph of the frequency response curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; Also called earth. Ground is defined as the point of zero voltage in a circuit or system, the reference point from which all other voltages are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In electrical power systems, ground connections are used for safety purposes, to keep equipment chassis and controls at zero voltage and to provide a safe path for errant currents. This is called a safety ground. Maintaining a good safety ground is essential to prevent electrical shock.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In sensitive electronic equipment, tiny currents and voltages riding on the ground (so it’s not truly zero volts) can cause noise in the circuits and hamper operation. Often a ground separate from the power ground is used as the reference point for the electronics, isolating the sensitive electronics from the dirty power ground. This is called a technical ground.
Hertz: The unit of frequency, equal to 1 cycle per second. Abbreviated Hz. kHz = 1000 Hz, and is usually pronounced “kay” (with “Hertz” implied) by sound professionals who ask for “a little more two and a half K” when they want you to boost 2.5 kHz (2500Hz).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impedance:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure of the AC resistance, capacitance, and inductance in an electrical circuit, measured in ohms;; all of these three properties impede the flow of current. AKA: the higher the impedance, the lower the current. In audio circuits (and other AC circuits) the impedance in ohms can often be much different from the circuit resistance as measured by a DC ohmmeter. Maintaining proper circuit impedance relationships is important to avoid distortion and minimize added noise.
Level: Another word for signal voltage, power, strength or volume. Audio signals are sometimes classified according to their level. Commonly used levels are: microphone level (-40 dBu or lower), instrument level (-20 to -10 dBu), and line level (-10 to +30 dBu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;￼￼￼￼￼&lt;strong&gt;Line level:&lt;/strong&gt;  A signal whose level falls between -10 dBu and +30 dBu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main (house) speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; The main loudspeakers for a sound reinforcement system. These are usually the largest and loudest loudspeakers, and are usually positioned so that their sound seems to come from the area of the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master:&lt;/strong&gt; A control affecting the final output of a bus on which one or more signals are mixed. A mixer may have several master controls, which may be slide faders or rotary controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic level:&lt;/strong&gt; The typical level of a signal from a microphone. A mic level signal (usually but not always coming from a microphone) is generally lower than -30 dBu. With a very quiet source (a pin dropping?) the signal can be -70 dBu or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic preamp:&lt;/strong&gt; Short for microphone preamplifier. An amplifier whose job is to bring the very low microphone level signal up to line level, or in the case of a mic preamp built into a mixer, the mixer’s internal operating level (approximately 0 dBu). Mic preamps often have their own volume control, called a trim control, to properly set the gain for a particular source. Setting the mic preamp gain correctly with the trim control is an essential step in establishing good signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient headroom for your mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound reinforcement, monitor speakers (or monitor headphones or in-the-ear monitors) are
those speakers used by the performers to hear themselves. In recording, the monitor speakers are those used by the engineer and production staff to listen to the recording as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever you don’t want to hear. Could be hum, buzz or hiss;; could be crosstalk or digital hash or your neighbor’s stereo;; could be white noise or pink noise or brown noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; A wiring method which electrically ties together two jacks or two poles of one jack so that in normal operation, there is signal flow between them. Inserting a plug breaks this connection, allowing the signal path to be modified. Normal wiring is common in patchbays and insert jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PA:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Public Address. An electronic amplification system used as a communication system in public areas. Today, people who work with PA systems like to say they’re working in “sound reinforcement”. Pan, pan pot: Short for panoramic potentiometer. A pan pot is used to position (or even dynamically move) a monaural sound source in a stereo mixing field by adjusting the source’s volume between the left and right channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch bay:&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of usually a large number of jacks allowing convenient access to various points in a system’s interconnect wiring. A patch bay can make re-routing signals very convenient without having to fish around with cables in the back of racks or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parametric EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A “fully” parametric EQ is an extremely powerful equalizer that allows smooth, continuous, and independent control of each of the three primary EQ parameters: frequency, gain, and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for Pre Fade Listen. Sound folks call it being able to solo a channel with the fader down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Power:&lt;/strong&gt; A system of providing electrical power for condenser microphones (and some electronic pickup devices) from the microphone input jack;; it provides +48V across two pins in a 3-pin XLR. The system is called phantom because the power is carried on standard microphone audio wiring in a way that is “invisible” to ordinary dynamic microphones. Generally, phantom power is safe to use with non-condenser microphones as well, especially dynamic microphones. However, unbalanced microphones, some electronic equipment (such as some wireless microphone receivers) and some ribbon microphones can short out the phantom power and be severely damaged. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; The time relationship between two signals, expressed in degrees around a circle. 0 and 360 degrees represents an in-phase relationship – both signals change in the same way at the same time. Anything else
is out of phase. 180 degrees out of phase is a special case which, for a continuous waveform, means that at any given time the two signals have the same amplitude but are opposite in polarity. The phase reverse switch found on some mixers or mic preamps actually reverses the signal polarity. When out-of-phase signals are mixed, there will be some cancellation at certain frequencies, the frequencies and the degree of cancellation being a function of the amount of phase shift and the relative amplitude of the signals. Attention to mic placement and careful listening will allow you to use this effect creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is not affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A return is a mixer line input dedicated to the task of returning processed or added sound from reverb, echo and other effects devices. Depending on the internal routing of your mixer and your own inclination, you could use returns as additional line inputs, or you could route your reverb outputs to ordinary line inputs rather than the returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverb:&lt;/strong&gt; The sound remaining in a room after the source of sound is stopped. Reverberation and echo are terms that are often used interchangeably, but in audio parlance a distinction is usually made: reverberation is considered to be a diffuse, continuously smooth decay of sound, whereas echo is one or more distinct, recognizable repetitions of a word, note, phrase or sound which decreases in amplitude with every repeat. Highly reverberant rooms are called live;; rooms with very little reverberation are called dead. A sound source without added reverb is dry;; one with reverb or echo added is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal-to-noise ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a specification that describes how much noise an audio component has compared to the signal. It is usually expressed in dB below a given output level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surround sound:&lt;/strong&gt; Multi-channel audio playback systems in 6, 8, or 10-channel formats. Surround sound is typically found in movie theaters and home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Ring-Sleeve, the three parts of a two-conductor (plus shield) phone plug. Since the plug or jack can carry two signals and a common ground, TRS connectors are often referred to as stereo or balanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Sleeve, the two parts of a single conductor (plus shield) phone plug. TS connectors are sometimes called mono or unbalanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbalanced:&lt;/strong&gt; An electrical circuit in which the two legs of the circuit do not have the identical impedance to ground. Often one leg is also at ground potential. Unbalanced circuit connections require only two conductors (signal “hot” and ground). Unbalanced audio circuitry is less expensive to build, but under certain circumstances is more susceptible to noise pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are actually sending some sort of image from your source: (very helpful to have the preview monitor at FOH set to the same source as the projector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source is the mac mini, try dragging a window to the right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a different source, make sure your display preferences are set up correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the lamp of the projector is actually on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Chrome, open the &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; bookmark. On the top left side there will be a little button that says Lamp and it will have on and off buttons on either side of the label. Make sure “ON” is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the image is not muted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xncCve2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Two&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###INTERMEDIATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####SOURCE = STAGE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THE &lt;strong&gt;BASIC&lt;/strong&gt; INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Decimator, its power adaptor, and one of the long Blue SDI Cables* from Janice [When using the SDI cables, be gentle with them, be careful not to kink them, and please coil them properly when striking] . You may also need an extension cord and / or a power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get whatever adaptors / other cables you need to be able send an HDMI signal to the Decimator from your source. (Probably a Thunderbolt to HDMI, or DVI to HDMI)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect one end of the Blue SDI Cable to the SDI OUTPUT on the Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the other end of the SDI Cable to one of the AVP Patch Points (If Downstage Right, use AV12, and run the cable up over the doorway.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your source HDMI cable to the Decimator’s HDMI INPUT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that your AVP Patch point (the one to which you connected the Blue SDI cable) is patched to AV38 in the patchbay (The default patching is AV12 to AV38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the KUMO Routing Interface (Chrome), select Projector on the Bottom Row and STAGE on the Top Row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get you an image. If it doesn’t, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;#troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; section above.
section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if none of that works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check Your SDI Patching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the Decimator is on (the screen will be lit).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the BNC Patching in the Patchbay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure AV38 at FOH is actually connected to something, it should be SDI input #3 on the back of the AJA in the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####REFOCUSING / SIZING THE IMAGE (Basic/ Without Presets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the projector interface on chrome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Basic Control” tab on the left&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the sets of arrows to adjust the image according to what you need&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For this you only have coarse adjust:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you click an arrow it will continue to adjust in that direction until you click the square in the center of the arrows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also, when focusing, try and have someone on stage close to the screen (or whatever you’re projecting onto) to confirm the focusing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/5Jrk0p3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Three&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####REFOCUSING / SIZING (Intermediate / With Presets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do all the same things you can do from the web interface, and more, from the projection booth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into the projection booth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the computer is on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The computer is in the left rack, underneath the HDCam players, and underneath the screen that pulls out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s a 1U rack unit with a disk drive on the left and a “SuperLogics” logo, there is a red power button on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push the power button and the fan will start up, letting you know that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull out the screen drawer (the black handle on the rack unit above the computer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;DCCs2&lt;/strong&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the communication settings window, make sure &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; is selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IP Address is:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.134&lt;/code&gt; Port is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;43728&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hx6h4VI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Four&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click OK (Also, the projector must be on in order to communicate with it. If it’s not on, nothing further will work. &lt;em&gt;And how were you planning to size an image if it’s off anyways?&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/O1bGrL9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Five&quot; /&gt;
7. Once the communication loading bar has completed and gone away, click the &lt;strong&gt;lens&lt;/strong&gt; tab at the top.
8. From the lens tab you have access to the focusing and resizing adjustments, as well as Fine Adjust mode, and &lt;em&gt;presets&lt;/em&gt;
	* SAVING A PRESET&lt;/p&gt;

 		* Make all the image adjustments you need
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Memory List&lt;/strong&gt; button to access the list of presets, then click a new row under all the ones that currently exist
 		* Click &lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt;, and name your preset, once it’s named you’re all good
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LOADING A PRESET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		* Select the preset you want to load
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; button, and the preset will begin to load

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####CONFIDENCE MONITORS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Confidence Monitors is sort of the opposite of running a source from the stage in terms of signal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out the Confidence Monitor rack case from Janice, grab one of the blue SDI cables, and get as many monitors and heavy duty DVI cables as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up the case where it will live during the show, it needs power and needs to be relatively close to both an AVP, and the monitors to which you will be running the DVI cables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the power cord for the rack supply, and turn the rack on. There should be blue and green lights that indicate that the unit is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the blue SDI cable to one of the AV patch points on the AVP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the patching in the patchbay is set up properly so that the AV patch point where you connected the SDI cable is hooked up to the point from where the signal at FOH is sending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the DVI cables from the back of the inside of the confidence monitor rack to the monitors you will be using, making sure to run the cable out of the way and to be gentle with the cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <id>performancehall.github.io/recording/handheld-tascam-tutorial</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-set-up&quot;&gt;Initial Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press and hold the Home button to turn on the Tascam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the battery indicator and replace if the battery is low.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to see if the SD card is actually in the device; if not, find one and insert it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-the-memory-to-ensure-theres-enough-space-for-your-recording&quot;&gt;Empty the memory to ensure there’s enough space for your recording:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press menu button to get to the menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use plus or minus buttons to scroll down to others, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to system, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to quick format, press enter.  Exec, enter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“All data erased. Are you sure?” Press enter and you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press menu to get back to the record screen and press the Rec Mode button to choose an input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay in “stereo” and then select your input under “source”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source will be either “Internal microphone” or “External in 1&amp;amp;2” (your XLR 1&amp;amp;2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing menu again will bring you back to the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-three-methods-of-taking-a-recording-in-the-penthouse&quot;&gt;There are three methods of taking a recording in the Penthouse:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to test it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp;amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, send the file to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;erinbrenner@uchicago.edu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording to the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter Erin’s email address (above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your email address press Send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Node Configuration Instructions</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/lighting/node-configuration.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/lighting/node-configuration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Plug the node into the lighting network and write down the ip address taped to the side of the node&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On a Mac:&lt;br /&gt;
Open System Preferences&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the Network Preferences page&lt;br /&gt;
Move the “Auditorium” Wi-Fi network&lt;br /&gt;
Click on Advanced&lt;br /&gt;
Go to the TCP/IP page&lt;br /&gt;
In the drop down menu where it says “Configure IPv4” select “Manually”&lt;br /&gt;
Give the computer an ip address of 192.169.0.199 (or any other ip address within the lighting network but not used by an entity on that network)&lt;br /&gt;
Give the computer a Subnet Mask of 255.255.255.0&lt;br /&gt;
Click OK and then click Apply&lt;br /&gt;
Open Firefox&lt;br /&gt;
Type in the ip address of the mode where you would enter a web address + /mini/&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if the ip address is: 192.168.0.72, you would type in 192.168.0.72/mini/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are only a few things that you should be changing in this screen, depending upon what you are configuring the node to do:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change whether the ports (DMX A and DMX B) output or input DMX by going to their respective pages within this screen by clicking on them and then selecting DMX in from the drop-down menu&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change what DMX universe (set of 512 DMX channels–usually we’ll just be using universes one and two to give the hall a total of 1024 addressable channels of lighting control) each port corresponds to by changing the “Netslot” field value of each port along the bottom of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To put a DMX port (A or B) in Universe 1, enter “1” for the “Netslot”. For Universe 2, you would enter 513 for the “Netslot”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reconfigure the node, make sure to change the label for each DMX port to reflect what it is doing (i.e. if you configure a port to be DMX in second universe, change the label to DMX IN U2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Click Update to upadate the node with the changes you made. The password is 2606. Go back to the DMX A and DMX B pages to make sure the desired changes held.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After reconfiguring the node, reboot the node by unplugging it from ethernet and plugging it back in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’re done! To make your computer connect to the regular internet again, go back to the Configure IPv4 drop down menu in system preferences and change it back to “Using DHCP” and apply the changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be sure to reconfigure the node to default (for output nodes, outputting universes 1 and 2 from their respective DMX ports) when striking the show.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Always arrive 10 minutes early for your call. If your call starts at 9am, that means you start working at 9am. Give yourself enough time to clock on, tool up, and get ready for work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to stay busy during your work call. If you have nothing to do, ask your other crew members and supervisor if they need help doing anything.
*If no one needs help, keep yourself busy by working on something else like tidying backstage or the storage closets, sweeping or mopping the stage, returning tools to their homes, or organizing gels in the catwalks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve finished cleaning and your co-workers/supervisor still don’t need assistance, either ask for a break or spend the time getting more familiar with systems that you might not yet understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If someone walks into the space while you are staring at your phone, book or computer, it reflects badly on the entire crew and building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-wear-and-not-wear&quot;&gt;What to Wear (and not wear)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appropriate-dress&quot;&gt;Appropriate Dress&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closed Toe shoes (no flip flops or birkenstocks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes you can move comfortably in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full length pants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appropriate tools for the job (flashlight, crescent wrench, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long hair is tied back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inappropriate-dress-do-not-wear&quot;&gt;Inappropriate Dress (DO NOT WEAR)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open-toed shoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High heels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dangly jewelry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skirts or dresses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Torn or dirty clothes (unless it’s a tech day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-notes&quot;&gt;More Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re working a show call and/or will be positioned backstage, wear all black (or as close as you can possibly get) with black/dark soft-soled shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NO shorts are allowed (unless it’s a tech day but even then, consider your knees).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re working at front of house, wear all black OR dark professional clothes: button down shirt, dress pants, nice shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t know how to do something, ask. It’s way better to spend more time on something during setup than to do something incorrectly if you’re unsure; we will all pay for it at showtime. Double/triple check everything you do and point out concerns or inconsistencies to the other crew members and supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to talk to those renting/using the spaces. Consider the implications of user requests before saying yes or no. If these requests are outside of your domain, bring that question to the right person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get access to the greenroom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Yes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we hang a curtain here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll have to ask my Stage Manager or Supervisor.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a 2nd wireless mic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll ask the audio engineer for you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a spotlight here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll ask the lighting engineer for you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a table in the lobby for check in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Yes. Then, go grab a table from 065 and bring it up to the lobby.
    If you’re short on time, or can’t follow through, reach out
    to Operations for support.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I peek through the stage door while people are in the house?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    No. Guide them to look at the video monitor at the Stage Manager
    Console instead (you have control over the camera, so you could
    scan the audience to get a feel for how crowded the house is).
    Otherwise, if they need a better view, tell them to sneak out
    into the lower vestibule and enter at the lower level entrance.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get a stage picture through the stage door?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Tell them to hold while you ask the person in charge of the event
    to approve this request. Opening the stage door for any reason
    other than an entrance will distract the audience, but in the
    end it’s up to the person running the show.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-shift-etiquette&quot;&gt;General Shift Etiquette&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lightheartedness and laughter are crucial and help us all get through long hours of hard labor, remember that you’re here to work. Try not to goof off too much while on the clock. Socialize after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing something that could potentially affect the entire crew, announce to everyone what you are doing. For example, if you are working in the catwalks or in a genie, shout, “Working overhead!” If you are bringing in a lineset, say, “Lineset moving!” or “U3 flying in!” Before you turn off all the lights off on stage or in the house, you should shout “Going dark!”. Always wait for acknowledgement from others in the space in the form of “Thank you!” before executing the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are patrons or members of the cast on stage or in the house and you need to be working up in the catwalks on lighting, check with your supervisor first. It may be better to wait until the space is empty. However, if time is tight, as it can often be, you may have to work despite others being in the way. Make sure those directly below you have cleared the area before continuing to work over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-covers&quot;&gt;Finding Covers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot make a shift for some reason, text/email other members of the crew to find a replacement. Let your manager know immediately. Your shift is your responsibility, so even if you have other things going on, get sick, injured or realize your have a paper due in the morning, you must find a cover because the show must go on. Be very careful when finding a cover because they must have the same skill set you do in order to do your job. Double check with this person the day before the shift to make sure they are still covering for you. If for some reason they fall through, it falls on you. Even one “incident” could put you into suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;physical-hazards--how-to-be-safe&quot;&gt;Physical Hazards / How to Be Safe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be smart about lifting heavy objects!
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you can’t lift it yourself, ask someone to help.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are lifting something onto a cart, bring the cart close to the object you are moving.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The less carrying, the less strain on your back. As always, lift with your knees and legs, not your back.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always confirm that lighting or audio equipment is off before plugging or unplugging anything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When using a blade, always cut away from yourself and others; be careful and use common sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear gloves and long sleeves when planning to touch hot lighting fixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always wear shoes while on the stage. The stage floor splinters terribly and nobody wants that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-the-hall&quot;&gt;Closing the Hall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When closing the hall, don’t ask if you can clock out or go home until:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is back in its place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stage/backstage/FOH are totally clean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is setup for the next event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the systems are shut down and the three sets of exterior doors (as well as auxiliary doors to the storage closet, instrument storage, and green room) are closed and locked securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;door-stops&quot;&gt;Door Stops:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always push door stops into the vestibules, not out into the hallways! This is exactly how they grow legs and walk away (/ get stolen by… other departments). Also, push them to the sides of the vestibules so other people walking in don’t trip over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;piano-safety&quot;&gt;Piano Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steinway is a big object on little wheels!
Move it slowly and be aware of all hazards AT ALL TIMES.
Do not allow it to come close to running into doors, door frames and walls or over items such as cables, curtain, or the little metal thresholds for the door closers.
Immediately lock it down after moving it by twisting the pins on the two wheels near the piano keys clockwise until tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have locked down the piano, tri-fold the cover lengthwise, and then roll it up and store it backstage.
Next, lift the cover off the piano keys.
Then, slide the built in music stand toward the keys and lift it up into place.
Ask the the pianist whether they would like the piano lid to be down, at half-stick, or at full-stick.
Always double check that the wheels are locked before lifting the lid.
The full stick sits in the square hole. The half stick sits in the circular hole.
Be extremely careful when handling the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always have at least two people moving the piano; a third is helpful to open doors and move anything that’s in the way.
These two people moving the piano, or at least one of them, should be from our team.
If you see a group trying to move a piano on their own, please step in and put your hands on that piano until it is in place, the wheels are locked, and everyone has stepped away.
Kindly open the lid for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-and-spiking-things&quot;&gt;Stage and Spiking Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to lock the stage wall panels.
If they need to be open at an angle where they cannot lock, sandbag them.
Sandbags can be found in the amp room. If you see bags sitting out, put them back in the amp room.
Confirm that the panels are locked by pushing them gently once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, double and triple check your work, if necessary, to avoid messing up an entire show. Take your time, ask questions, do it right the first time and you won’t have to be embarrassed when it fails or waste everyone’s time while doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, spike the upstage offstage corners of objects.
Spike the piano with L’s on the upstage and offstage sides of the legs.
Spike music stands with T’s directly under the vertical of the stand. Have the long line of the T point the direction the stand faces. If you have more than one stage change, color code each setup. You can even write a note to yourself on the spike tape. Use sharpie or pen and keep it simple. If there is going to be a lot of movement/big set changes, it is a good idea to draw up a stage plot of each change and label the page with the appropriate color of spike tape. If marley is down, put a piece of clear tape over each spike to make sure it doesn’t get danced off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-stage-directions&quot;&gt;Know Your Stage Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Left and Stage Right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking stage directions, you always refer to it from the artist’s perspective. If you are standing on stage, facing the audience, your left is stage left and right is stage right. If you are standing in the audience, or at FOH, and you are calling out stage movement, your left will become “stage right” and your right is “stage left”. Same rule applies to someone standing backstage left and looking onto stage from the wing; away from you should be referred to as “stage right”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On and Off Stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, if you’re standing at a funny angle, up in the genie, or it doesn’t matter which direction you’re going, it may be easier for you to explain yourself using “on stage” and “off stage.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Off stage” is always referring to the direction further away from the center line of the stage and towards the wings in either direction.
Moving something “on stage” would mean to move it toward the center line from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstage and Downstage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstage is on the stage further away from the audience, so towards the ‘back’ of the stage.
Downstage is further towards the audience, so towards the ‘front’ of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying in and out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we refer to things that are moving up and down. Battens and banners fly in when they are moving down from the ceiling and they fly out when moving back up toward the ceiling. Always call out, in your loudest speaking voice, to the whole room when you are flying battens in or out. Example: Batten 2 flying out! Or U6 flying in! The response should be: Thank you flying in! or Thank you U6!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stagehand Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assistance with costume changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other duties include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping other crew members with their set-ups.
Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Before the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a program and take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t pay attention to your phone!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During your scene changes:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move quickly and with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###After the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike and clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we’re not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Stage Terminology</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-terminology/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-terminology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apron: The portion of the stage that is downstage of the proscenium arch. (Since we don’t have a built in proscenium in the hall, we consider the apron to be everything downstage of the ‘plaster line’.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Batten: Part of a fly system. A horizontal pipe, supported by lift lines, electrical hoists (ours are drum winch) &amp;amp; motors (variable speed), which is easily raised and lowered; even while holding a substantial amount of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blackout: Removing all light from the stage, often for a set change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boom: A boom is a vertical pipe standing anywhere onstage where lighting units are hung on stage, usually in the wings. They are usually screwed into 50lb boom bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catwalks: A catwalk is a section of the house hidden in the ceiling from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Center Line: A special type of line drawn on a Ground Plan, located at the plane which bisects the stage left and stage right sides of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crossover: The upstage place behind any stage curtains or scenery, which allows performers to get from one side of the stage to the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cue: Any moment in the course of a performance where there is a change in the physical state. In the case of sound, a cue might start music playing, and then a subsequent cue might lower the volume as an actor starts to speak, and yet another might fade the music to silence when the scene comes to an end. Cues are most often associated with lighting and sound (any given show quite often has hundreds of light and sound cues), but cues are also established when scenery needs to change, line sets need to fly, effects need to be triggered, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dimmer room: The room which contains the dimmer racks which power the lighting rig in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric: An electric is a horizontal pipe hanging upstage of the proscenium (usually part of the fly system), often with lighting circuits connected to it, where lighting units are hung in a theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly System: A series of pulleys, ropes, wires, and/or other apparatus which collectively allows the hanging and vertical movement of curtains, lighting instruments, scenery, and even people. (Our fly system is motorized electrical drum winch hoists and controlled through the automated rigging system.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grand Curtain (or Main Curtain): The curtain that closes just upstage of the proscenium arch. Generally speaking, opening the grand curtain signifies the start of the show or act and closing it signifies the end of the act or show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House: The place where the audience sits to watch the performance. Also the place where lighting instruments hang when they’re hanging over the audience. Front-of-House can refer to the lobby or other non-performance space where audience members congregate before and after the show and during intermission. (Just to confuse things, Audio Engineers also refer to front-of-house, or FOH, as their house mix position in order to differentiate themselves from the the monitor engineer on stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Masking: As a noun, anything which hides something from the audience. As a verb, the act of hiding things from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plaster Line: An imaginary reference line on stage that indicates where the proscenium arch is. (Our plaster line runs stage left to right from about the point where the stage starts to curve on the downstage lip.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proscenium Arch: The viewing portal or frame through which the audience sees the performance. (Our Proscenium Arch is theoretical except for when the grand curtain and border are hanging on U1 and U2.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shell: A hard, often movable surface, designed to reflect sound into the audience for musical performances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sight lines: Imaginary lines indicating the view from the extreme-most seats. If someone or something is said to be in sight lines, it means that they are visible to all audience members regardless of seating choice. If someone or something is described as out of sightlines, it means that no audience members are able to see them. A good rule of thumb for sightlines is “if you can see them, they can see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soft Goods: Curtains that are used onstage. This can include the “Blacks,” “Cyc,” “Grand Curtain,” and “Scrims,” among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spike: Marking the stage floor with an indicator showing the location of a set piece or where a performer should stand. Spike marks are usually made on the upstage corners of a prop with small pieces of spike tape to show the direction it should be facing and also color coded by set transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage/Deck: The primary playing space surrounded by the apron, wings, and fly space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike: Strike can be referred to as temporarily taking something away (e.g. “During the scene change, you strike the phone.”).  It can also be used at the end of a run to specify that everything should be disassembled, put away and cleaned in order to have a fresh canvas for the next group coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trim: The height that a batten or any other object hangs at.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wings: Areas that are part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are typically masked with legs. The wing space is used for performers preparing to enter, storage of sets for scenery changes and as a stagehand work area. Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the fly system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Stage Manager Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-manager-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Out of all the members of the crew on the show call, congratulations, you have the most duties. You are the liaison between the crew and the performers. All stage management duties follow a logic of making a show run smoothly. Communicate with your crew and the visiting production team and you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Before the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, go up to Erin’s office and get the stage management keys. Keep them on you for the rest of the night. Don’t forget to return them at the end of the night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the space, propping open backstage doors and the green room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock the backstage cabinet.  Make sure it stays closed throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Scene Control, the stage manager console, and the amp room sequencer (plus sub amp).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your backstage monitor at the stage manager console. Make sure that there are no banners in the way and that the camera is in focus so you can see the stage. If you can’t see anything on your monitor, check in with your supervisor or other crew members. They can help you fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the board operators and visiting production team. While the board ops are in charge of discussing their specific needs, you should have a general grasp of what is happening on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find out if the group has any digital materials. While digital files for projection or audio playback should be handed over to your board ops, digital signage for the lobby LCD screens will be inserted by you at the Stage Manager console. (More on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternately, you can send the live camera feed to the lobby monitors after rehearsals are finished, once the stage has cleared and house is open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a copy of the program. If there is none, speak with someone from the team and build one out. Take notes on entrances, exits, and cues (both light and sound). Some groups will provide their own cue sheet. Determine the entire show flow:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time is the show supposed to start?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time should the doors open to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there an intermission? If so, for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When is the show scheduled to end?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who will be walking onto stage, when and from where? Do they need mics?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your clearcom backstage. Your headset, pack, and cable are in the drawer in the stage management console. Spares are in the upstage right cabinet.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do a clearcom check with your board operators. Have them go on headset. Check if you can hear one another, your volumes are set properly and your call buttons work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During Doors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right after doors are open, put the DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR sign on the back of the downstage left door. From this point on, YOU are the only person allowed to open this door. DO NOT let anyone (even Bill or Obama) run past you onto stage without clearing it with lighting and sound first. FOH relies on you heavily to start the show only after they are ready. Own this door, it’s yours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk over to the green room and inform performers that the house is now open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five minutes prior to show, give a 5 minute warning to members of the cast and crew. If performers request more time, let your house staff know if they need to hold doors or if the show will start late.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your first performers backstage. Keep them backstage and ready to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the show is ready to start, tell your friends at FOH to begin the process of house lights to half. This will notify the audience to take their seats and prepare for the start of the show. Allow one minute for everyone to get settled and then request the lighting operator to bring the house lights all the way out and into the first lighting look - usually stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for confirmation that the light change is in progress and send out your performers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the performers are out, close the inner vestibule doors as to isolate sound from the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.  Cross out movements/acts as they finish to stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the backstage left monitor for stage movement. Be ready and open the door if someone is walking offstage.  Make sure you actually open the door before they get close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If handing out wireless microphones, remember to check that they are on/have full battery strength before handing them out. Confirm with your sound board op as to which mic you’ve given out. Make sure you get the mic back when the person exits stage, turn it off if it won’t be in use again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are nervous the person using the mic will accidentally turn it off during their performance, or if the sound board operator has requested it, put a sleeve on the microphone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help nervous actors, musicians and other talent by being a calming force. Exude confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are the backstage point person throughout the entire show, help talent with anything they need - water, towel, safety pin, costume change, even a bucket to puke in (use a lined garbage can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###After the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return your ClearCom &amp;amp; cable to its drawer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike what needs to be struck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the hall usable for the next day’s crew. For example, if you used the piano but the next crew will not, return it to instrument storage. If you didn’t use the piano but they will, bring it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up and throw away any garbage or show specific paperwork. Empty the trash bin backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to return any personal items left behind.  If the group is long gone, leave these items with the lost and found at the North Desk and tell the building manager on duty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everyone has cleared out, make sure all 3 entrances are closed and locked, as well as the green room entrances, storage closets, and stage door.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you turned on scene control, turn it off and reconnect its key with the stage manager key set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: DO NOT FORGET to return the stage manager key set to Erin’s office. The next morning’s crew will not be able to do anything without this key set and will have to hunt you down. Public shaming will ensue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, logistical mishaps, or mischievous deviants, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report instead if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Guide to Soft Goods</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/soft-goods-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/soft-goods-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What most people refer to as “curtains” are actually called “soft goods” within the technical theater community. As opposed to “hard goods,” soft goods have the capability to fold. These goods include items such as legs, borders, scrims, full stage blacks, and grand curtains (also referred to as main curtain). The Performance Hall at the University of Chicago has all of these. This section guides you through identifying, hanging, folding, and handling these various soft goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anatomy-of-a-soft-good&quot;&gt;Anatomy of a Soft Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every soft good’s basic components are named in relation to how it hangs on stage. A good’s top, bottom, back and front are easily identifiable even when folded. When one of these goods is set up on stage, the top refers to the end near the ceiling, the bottom to the end at the floor, the front refers to the side facing the audience, the back is the side the audience can’t see.
Along the top of the good is a row of lengths of tie line. These tie lines are used to attach it to the pipe. When tying these lines to a batten, use a knot like tying your shoes. First, tie a simple half hitch, or what is commonly known as a single knot. Then, finish with a bow. Never tie a double knot. The ties on every good are all black except for one white tie; the white tie is your center tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top of the good is a handwritten label, naming the good and giving specifications related to the size of the good. When taking down and folding it, the label must always end up on the outside of the roll so future stagehands can easily identify it. You’ll notice only the Legs and Film Screen Masking curtains have chain at the bottom. The purpose of this chain is to stretch the good down to the stage and keep it from moving if touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hanging&quot;&gt;Hanging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hanging a soft good, first determine if it requires fullness or tautness (a loose or a tight look). Our borders and legs usually require fullness whereas our scrim and the full stage black need to be hung taut. Knots should be tight against the batten pipe unless instructed otherwise.  Never hang soft goods on a batten where they will be in direct contact with lights. This is a fire hazard. Talk to your supervisor and the visiting production team to determine a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;takedown--flying-soft-goods&quot;&gt;Takedown / Flying Soft Goods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying-in any batten, pull together a ground crew to watch the pipe from stage level. While watching the pipe for possible collisions, your ground crew should also do an initial rough accordion folding of the curtain, making sure the front velour doesn’t accidentally fall forward onto the floor. Do not pull it too hard on the curtains as you fold them; you do not want to put too much stress on the rigging or move the pipe much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the batten has stopped moving, untie the goods and fly the pipe out again so there is nothing in the way while folding. Before you start moving the curtain around and spreading it out to fold, make sure all of the front is always face up and the back is face down. The back is a rougher texture than the velvety front, so it’s easy to tell the difference. It is important that the good rolls only on its back, so as to “save face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;folding&quot;&gt;Folding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always have a buddy or two helping when folding soft goods. It is possible to fold solo, but it is very, very hard. Before flying-in any soft good, first clear the deck and sweep the floor! We want to keep our curtains looking tidy for a number of good reasons. Never walk on any of the soft goods with shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay the first curtain out flat onstage. Each good is folded differently, so have a clear plan on how you will fold each one before you do. Most of our curtains are folded bottom to top (as many times as needed) then rolled from one side to the other, as to fit into the bin, with the information label facing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folding (with your buddy) run one side’s corners to the other side’s corner trying to catch air in between the top and bottom sections. Capturing air also makes folding easier, resulting in less drag and allows you a few moments to fix problem areas with ease. Have a third person catching and realigning the center lines as they will be the biggest problems. Always remember to make sure your lines are even and edges match. Do not forget about the bottom half just because you can’t see it anymore! Each piece should be flat and even. If your fold has overshot the bottom edge, redo the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legs&quot;&gt;Legs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legs are used to create wings. They come in pairs, one hung with fullness on each side of the stage on the same batten. The Performance Hall has four sets of legs. Keep each leg with its buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to hanging legs, determine whether you need pipe extensions in each end of the batten. Also, determine how far onstage the legs are needed for the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First tie the onstage and offstage ties where you want them, then tie the center tie line. Now you have 2 identical sections that need their centers tied. Once those are tied, you will have 4 sections that need their centers tied. Continue to tie 50% marks until all ties are evenly spaced and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flying the batten out, the person running the rigging console is responsible for gathering a ground crew and ensuring that nothing crashes into the architecture. The ground crew (of at least 2 people) is responsible for watching the pipe and attachments, as well as physically unfolding the legs as they fly. ALWAYS have eyes on both ends of the batten as you fly it out so that you don’t damage the walls, ceiling, the battens or other people on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are dirty, stop flying them out and clean them as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person at scene control must stop the batten before it reaches its upper limit where it sits in its ceiling pocket. With the extensions in, it will not fit; it must sit below its home. Again, ALWAYS watch the batten as you raise it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the legs far enough out so their bottoms sit just barely on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk up to FOH to double check that they are evenly placed on stage. If they’re not perfectly even or end up covering the speakers, redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the leg out the length of the stage, front side face up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legs are folded over twice (side to side), and then rolled bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once laid out, check where the label is on the top section. This side will remain on the floor as you fold toward it so it is on the outside when you put the leg away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one edge starts to cone inwards while the other cones out, unroll and reroll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware at this point that one side of the good may be thicker than the other. The thicker side should be kept as tight as possible. The other should loosen just enough to keep it even.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the rolled leg into the bin using the help of gravity. Tipping the bin and rolling the good inside will usually be harder than picking the good up and dropping it inside, but can be done if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;borders&quot;&gt;Borders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borders are used with legs to complete the proscenium look. They are also used to hide other things hanging in the air, such as lights &amp;amp; other things in the air. They run the width of the stage, but only hang down a few feet from the ceiling. Our borders are also used as a skirt to mask the bottom of the film screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s borders are stored in the same bins as the legs. Borders would normally be hung 1 pipe downstage of a set of legs, but because our space was designed with some oddities, there’s really only one good place to hang a border and that’s U3. U3 is special because it does not interfere with the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as with the legs, use the 50% rule when tying the border to the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the batten out all the way, always keeping eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The border itself is much longer than the width of the stage, so open the downstage panels to allow yourself more room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lay the border out so the center is farther offstage and prepare the first half by spreading it out and laying the onstage side flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold this edge to the center line evenly and then pull the border across the stage to give yourself room to repeat the process with the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flatten out the unfolded side and fold to the center line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that you have the whole thing fitting on stage, fold the bottom to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s impossible to keep the label on the outside of a border, since we’ve brought both ends to the center, so just keep track of which one you’re working with before rolling and binning it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borders aren’t as easy to lift, but they’re still liftable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-stage-black-fsb&quot;&gt;Full Stage Black (FSB)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full stage black is usually used to cover the upstage wall or to cut the depth of stage in half. In the Performance Hall, it can be hung from U3, U4, U6 and D-Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Full Stage Black&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the full stage black on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting at center and working offstage, tie every other tie until you reach the end of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back at center, pull your knots away from the center, pulling the fabric taut in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop when the bottom of the FSB rests on the deck of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Full Stage Black&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold the good bottom to top, making sure to catch lots of air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this twice with the new bottom edge you have created, folding the good a total of three times, always bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the good so the label stays on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the hamper over and set it on it’s side, roll the good inside, and carefully tip it back up. You will need another person to do this, the hamper will now be very heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scrims-white-and-black&quot;&gt;Scrims (white and black)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall has two scrims, a black scrim and a white scrim. They are stored in the same bin upstage but inside canvas bags to keep them from pilling on each other.  Unlike the other soft goods in the Performance Hall, scrims are used aesthetically, to both bounce and transmit light. They are often used in dance pieces, alongside a ground row of strip or cyc lights.  They are sometimes used as an alternate upstage projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the scrims are so light, they will need to be bottom-piped once they’re flown out. Bottom pipe can be found in the storage room across from the greenroom. They are the lightweight aluminum pipes that fit together, end to end. When bottom-piping the scrim, make sure the pipe sits in the inner nylon pocket, not the outer fabric pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrims are hung and folded in the same manner as the full stage black. When hanging, start in the center and work your way off stage then go back and pull tautness into the fabric. When folding, fold bottom to top 3 times before rolling toward the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hampers&quot;&gt;Hampers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the Performance Hall’s soft goods are stored in hampers that live along the upstage wall backstage. Each hamper is labelled according to its contents. The hampers are only just small enough to pass through the upstage corridor and downstage doors to the stage. Be careful when moving them, as their hinges may catch on the architecture. For extra precaution, open panels to get the bins onstage. Determine whether you need to lay the bin on its side before loading or unloading goods. If you do, lay it down with its open lid on the floor. Be aware of the locks! Be extremely careful to not scratch the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Penthouse Lightboard Cheatsheet</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/penthouse-lightboard-cheatsheet/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/penthouse-lightboard-cheatsheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;###Startup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn on board via power switch under front lip of board&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure all cables are plugged in first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board will take a while to start up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the top bank of sliders (they are labeled on the board) to create different lighting looks in the room and shift between them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###If you want to bring up specific lights, refer to the “magic sheet” image further down this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type in the number corresponding to the lights you want to bring up on the number pad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then hit [@] and a value from 0-100 and then [Enter] to set their brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit the [Undo] key several times to turn them off and release control of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###To shut the board down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move the mouse to the top of the screen so the menu bar appears, click on the File menu and then Click Exit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then click the power button in the lower left corner of the screen, to the right of where it says “Run Palette.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The board will then (slowly) shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###If the Board Crashes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can hard power down the board by holding down the power button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only do this if you absolutely need to!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Lighting Board Operator Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/lighting-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/lighting-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-the-show&quot;&gt;Before the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take notes on lighting cues needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure &lt;strong&gt;EP LOCKOUT&lt;/strong&gt; is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-show&quot;&gt;During the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.
Communicate with the stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-the-show&quot;&gt;After the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Genie Use and Safety</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/genie-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/genie-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-safety-tips&quot;&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-use-the-genie&quot;&gt;To use the genie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-put-the-genie-away&quot;&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>General Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/general-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/general-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Always check the &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; to see what company you’ll be working with for your shift. If you’re lucky, the visiting artists have been responsive, thought ahead, and had the foresight to fully plan out their performance details.  If so, a basic rundown of what needs to be done will be in the calendar notes section. Make a mental note of these tasks and be prepared to accomplish all. Ask questions ahead of time if you have any, such as “Do we need to check out any gear from the cage?” or “What time is the talent arriving?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clocking in and out&lt;/strong&gt; is important; don’t mess this part up or HR will start to dislike you as a person. They are the ones that write your checks, so seriously, don’t mess this part up. It’s your responsibility to remember to do this. If for some reason you forgot to clock in or out at the right time, immediately send an email to Erin detailing the time/date that you did clock in/out vs the time/date that you were supposed to clock in/out.  Words like “today”, “yesterday” and “last Monday” don’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/12/stagehand-guide.html&quot;&gt;Stagehand Guide&lt;/a&gt;, you should dress appropriately to each crew call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as an event on the &lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; calendar, do not fail to dress the part.  If you are normally backstage, you must wear black head to toe. If you know you will be sitting at front of house, you can either wear all blacks or professional clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as something on the &lt;strong&gt;Rehearsal&lt;/strong&gt; calendar, feel free to relax those standards a bit.  If nothing else is scheduled coinciding with your shift, you can expect tech work and should wear more comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you complete your tasks quickly and see others still working, go lend them a hand. This is not a union house–you can cross between departments. Whoever you may be, meet up with the rest of the crew or the members of a visiting production team. Understand what is expected of you throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-show&quot;&gt;During the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you do not have anything to do for a while, do not busy yourself with homework, reading, or facebook. Your actions distract audience members and artists while you end up looking lazy to the other professionals. Watch and pay attention to the show. You never know what is going to happen on stage and if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss your cue. If you cannot spare four or six hours to work a show, then you should not take the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be extra quiet while a performance is taking place.  The hall was designed with acoustics in mind. Someone speaking at a normal volume on stage can be heard throughout the entire room.  Remember this when talking through clear com at the FOH position, especially during quieter parts of the show. With a headset on, what might seem like a whisper to you can be heard by everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you need to walk away from your post for a moment, let the rest of the crew know by saying, “[your name] going off headset.” Give the other crew members a second to respond in case they have something important to say before you go. When you return, let them know you’re back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; act professionally. Your actions reflect the entire crew, your bosses, the venue and building.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Video Rack Guide</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/video/video-rack-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/video-rack-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video rack is a bit of a beast of a rig. Don’t be frightened by it.
There are a lot of wires and components on the inside of it, but most of the actual signal flow is relatively simple. In this tutorial we’ll break down the sections of it that you need to know, and explain how the signals flow into, out of and within the rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-sections&quot;&gt;Major Sections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac Pro
Multiview
Converters
IO Panel
USB Hub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;io-panel&quot;&gt;IO Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where all the signals come into and out of the rack. As such, if you need to troubleshoot anything, this is the place to start. In an ideal world, you shouldn’t change anything further down the signal chain than the IO Panel. If changing things here doesn’t resolve your issues, think long and hard before you go changing any connections beyond this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;io-panel-connections&quot;&gt;IO Panel Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SWITCHED:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the switched power that feeds the Furman relay. It is switched via the switch on the front of the Furman, and feeds power to a number of the video converters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNSWITCHED:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This power connection feeds :&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creston:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the Crestron Fiber optic connection&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FW32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NETWORK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NETWORK&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROJECTOR:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the DVI feed out to the Projector. The cable travels along the trough under FOH and comes up in Projection Boot and plugs into one of the DVI ports on the bottom of front panel of the left most rack by the projectors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STAGE IN SDI
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is fed from V37 and is used to route a signal from somewhere on stage up to the KUMO&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STAGE OUT SDI
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This feeds V38 and is used to route a signal from one of the KUMO inputs to a display feed somewhere other than FOH, usually for confidence monitors or projectors on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AMX MON
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;(INACTIVE?)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BLANK SDI&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FOH IN
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is where the FOH HDMI cable patches into the video rack. From here it connects to the FOH HDMI AJA Converter and from there into the Decimator Multiview and on to the KUMO.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MULTIVIEW
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the HDMI feed that comes from the Multiview and goes to the Right hand Display on the FOH desk.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DISPLAY (?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CRESTRON
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the HDMI port that feeds the HDMI input on the Crestron panel on the ABP under the FOH Desk.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIDI IN
MIDI OUT
* AES3 IN
* AES3 OUT
* KUMO L
* KUMO R&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-sense-of-it-all&quot;&gt;Making Sense of it All&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing that will help you to understand how the video rack works is to have an understanding of the underlying signal flow. If you can understand how the signals move around and are altered in an abstract fashion, making sense of the cable mess becomes, if not easier, then a little more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video signals that run into, out of and around the video rack come in two ‘flavors’, SDI (specifically &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;__) and HDMI. Any time you need to make a change between the two formats, you need a converter. The converters in the rack take the form of the small grey AJA boxes. These AJA boxes accomplish the same function as the larger, bright red Decimator boxes that you may have seen around before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why exactly are we converting between SDI and HDMI in the first place? Why can’t we just use one format? The answer to those questions has to do with the nature of the Hardware we use for various purposes in the hall. HDMI can be thought of as more of a consumer level format. You use it to connect your laptop or computer to a monitor or TV or a small projector. SDI on the other hand, is a format used in higher profile professional hardware, such as the NEC Projector (the one in the projection booth), video switching hardware like the AJA KUMO, and for transporting video signals over distances longer than a couple feet without signal degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we often deal with multiple video signals that we like to be able to switch between for displaying various media during shows, we use specialized hardware to be able to switch between all of our signals. For us, this hardware is the AJA KUMO 1604, which has 16 SDI inputs and 4 SDI outputs. The KUMO can route any of the 16 inputs to any of the 4 outputs and can switch back and forth relatively seamlessly, with control being accessed via a network connection than you can call up in a browser (See the ‘KUMO’ bookmark in Chrome on the FOH Mac Pro).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we have an HDMI signal on a laptop at FOH that we want to be able to route to a display on stage, one way to do this would be to just hook the HDMI up to a Decimator, take the SDI output, patch it to the ABP and do the opposite on stage. However if we want to be able to switch the signal that the display receives, we would want to hook the HDMI upto an HDMI to SDI converter (like the Decimator or the AJA boxes), and run the SDI into the AJA, so that we can switch the display’s feed back and forth between this HDMI and the other signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiview&quot;&gt;Multiview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve covered why we need to convert signals and how the KUMO accomplishes the signal switching we like to be able to do, but one thing we’ve yet to discuss is the Multiview and how that fits into the signal chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re switching back and forth between the various video feeds we have to deal with during a show, it’s convenient if not necessary to be able to see what each signal is to ensure that we’re not going to go live on a blank screen or some other unsuitable feed. The Multiview allows us to quickly inspect a lot of different signals quickly to make sure everything is how it should be. However in order to do this, it needs all the signals we worry about to flow through it. This makes our lives a little more difficult in terms of troubleshooting things, and certainly makes the video rack a lot messier, but provides necessary functionality that outweighs these costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to revisit our previous example, we have an HDMI signal we want to be able to get from a laptop at FOH down to a display or projector on the stage. We patch into the FOH HDMI cable that sits at the desk. That cable goes into the IO Panel on the back of the video rack. From there an HDMI cable runs inside the rack to an AJA HDMI to SDI converter. The SDI cable that comes out of that carrying our signal goes into an input on the multiview and comes out unchanged on a loop output from the multiview. From the multiview the new SDI cable patches to an input on the back of the AJA KUMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of this is that the signal the Multiview is getting and showing us from the FOH HDMI is the same as the signal it then sends to the input on the KUMO. The multiview lets us look at a number of the signals we’re getting on the ‘Preview Monitor’, so that we can know what we’re getting before we switch our signals with the KUMO.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Projection Cheat Sheet</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/video/projection-cheat-sheet.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/projection-cheat-sheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;BASIC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SOURCE = MacMini or FOH HDMI&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the Switcher Rack On (Black on / off flip switch, right side)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On the AMX Touch interface, hit “Turn on system and projector”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Open Chrome on the Mac Mini and Open the Kumo Bookmark&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Click Projector on the Bottom Row&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Select your source on the Top Row&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Hs68lLj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;if-that-doesnt-get-you-an-image-now-we-start&quot;&gt;If that doesn’t get you an image now we start:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;TROUBLESHOOTING&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are actually sending some sort of image from your source: (very helpful to have the preview monitor at FOH set to the same source as the projector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source is the mac mini, try dragging a window to the right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a different source, make sure your display preferences are set up correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the lamp of the projector is actually on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Chrome, open the &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; bookmark. On the top left side there will be a little button that says Lamp and it will have on and off buttons on either side of the label. Make sure “ON” is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the image is not muted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xncCve2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Two&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intermediate&quot;&gt;INTERMEDIATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;source--stage&quot;&gt;SOURCE = STAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THE &lt;strong&gt;BASIC&lt;/strong&gt; INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Decimator, its power adaptor, and one of the long Blue SDI Cables* from Janice [When using the SDI cables, be gentle with them, be careful not to kink them, and please coil them properly when striking] . You may also need an extension cord and / or a power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get whatever adaptors / other cables you need to be able send an HDMI signal to the Decimator from your source. (Probably a Thunderbolt to HDMI, or DVI to HDMI)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect one end of the Blue SDI Cable to the SDI OUTPUT on the Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the other end of the SDI Cable to one of the AVP Patch Points (If Downstage Right, use AV12, and run the cable up over the doorway.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your source HDMI cable to the Decimator’s HDMI INPUT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that your AVP Patch point (the one to which you connected the Blue SDI cable) is patched to AV38 in the patchbay (The default patching is AV12 to AV38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the KUMO Routing Interface (Chrome), select Projector on the Bottom Row and STAGE on the Top Row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get you an image. If it doesn’t, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;#troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if none of that works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check Your SDI Patching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the Decimator is on (the screen will be lit).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the BNC Patching in the Patchbay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure AV38 at FOH is actually connected to something, it should be SDI input #3 on the back of the AJA in the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing--sizing-the-image-basic-without-presets&quot;&gt;REFOCUSING / SIZING THE IMAGE (Basic/ Without Presets)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the projector interface on chrome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Basic Control” tab on the left&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the sets of arrows to adjust the image according to what you need&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For this you only have coarse adjust:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you click an arrow it will continue to adjust in that direction until you click the square in the center of the arrows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also, when focusing, try and have someone on stage close to the screen (or whatever you’re projecting onto) to confirm the focusing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do all the same things you can do from the web interface, and more, from the projection booth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into the projection booth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the computer is on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The computer is in the left rack, underneath the HDCam players, and underneath the screen that pulls out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s a 1U rack unit with a disk drive on the left and a “SuperLogics” logo, there is a red power button on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push the power button and the fan will start up, letting you know that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull out the screen drawer (the black handle on the rack unit above the computer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;DCCs2&lt;/strong&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the communication settings window, make sure &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; is selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IP Address is:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.134&lt;/code&gt; Port is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;43728&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hx6h4VI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Four&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click OK (Also, the projector must be on in order to communicate with it. If it’s not on, nothing further will work. &lt;em&gt;And how were you planning to size an image if it’s off anyways?&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/O1bGrL9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Five&quot; /&gt;
7. Once the communication loading bar has completed and gone away, click the &lt;strong&gt;lens&lt;/strong&gt; tab at the top.
8. From the lens tab you have access to the focusing and resizing adjustments, as well as Fine Adjust mode, and &lt;em&gt;presets&lt;/em&gt;
	* SAVING A PRESET&lt;/p&gt;

 		* Make all the image adjustments you need
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Memory List&lt;/strong&gt; button to access the list of presets, then click a new row under all the ones that currently exist
 		* Click &lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt;, and name your preset, once it’s named you’re all good
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LOADING A PRESET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		* Select the preset you want to load
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; button, and the preset will begin to load

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confidence-monitors&quot;&gt;CONFIDENCE MONITORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Confidence Monitors is sort of the opposite of running a source from the stage in terms of signal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out the Confidence Monitor rack case from Janice, grab one of the blue SDI cables, and get as many monitors and heavy duty DVI cables as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up the case where it will live during the show, it needs power and needs to be relatively close to both an AVP, and the monitors to which you will be running the DVI cables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the power cord for the rack supply, and turn the rack on. There should be blue and green lights that indicate that the unit is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the blue SDI cable to one of the AV patch points on the AVP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the patching in the patchbay is set up properly so that the AV patch point where you connected the SDI cable is hooked up to the point from where the signal at FOH is sending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the DVI cables from the back of the inside of the confidence monitor rack to the monitors you will be using, making sure to run the cable out of the way and to be gentle with the cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <link href="performancehall.github.io/video/overflow-video-streams.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/overflow-video-streams</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;setting-up-mezzanine-and-lobby-overflow-video-streams&quot;&gt;Setting up Mezzanine and Lobby Overflow Video Streams&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up a video feed for the Gidwitz Lobby Displays and the Mezzanine,
you will need the following equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(2) Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(3) SDI Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(2) XLR Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(3) HDMI Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) XLR-&amp;gt;RCA Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) 1/4”-&amp;gt;XLR Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Haivision Encoder (stays in the Amp rack)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Haivision Decoder (borrowed from another space)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Long (25ft or more) Ethernet Cable (will need to be checked out from the cage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(n) Large Portable TV (located on the 11th floor, will need to be checked out from the cage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(n) Hai-vision Decoder Remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foh-setup&quot;&gt;FOH Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an external videographer, skip this section. If there is no videographer, we will need to use equipment from the cage.
Check out a video camera and a tripod and set them up next to the FOH desk. We recommend the Sony PMW-EX1R HD Video Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up an audio feed for the videographer’s camera on the Venue with an AUX patched to an unused output(x).
This aux should include all live mics and digital audio channels.
Connect AUX-out(x) to the camera’s XLR-in and make sure the audio is routed to SDI-out on the camera.
Using the SDI cable, patch the camera into V40 at the FOH AVP under the desk.
Set up another AUX on the Venue (should be a copy of the first) so that it is patched to another unused output (y).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amp-room-setup&quot;&gt;Amp Room Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect power to the Decimator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patch V40 video output into Decimator SDI input using an SDI patch cable (these can be found on the wall and have a tube connection on one end and an SDI connection on the other).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the Decimator’s HDMI-out to the Haivision Encoder’s HDMI-&amp;gt;DVI-in adapter using a short HDMI cable.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The encoder is located in the open slot in the rightmost rack towards the top, labeled ‘Performance Hall’. You can place the Decimator in this slot next to the encoders.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To run the cable you will have to feed it through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take output (y) you patched at the Venue from ‘Venue Outputs’ (center column in the amp room; APB-07; red and white labels) with ¼”-&amp;gt;XLR cable, connect it to the XLR-&amp;gt;RCA cable, and plug the RCA-outs into the RCA-ins at the back of the  encoder.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Again, feed the cable through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run SDI from the Decimator’s SDI-out to SM console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&amp;lt;-SDI-in, SDI-out(1)&amp;lt;-SDI-in (make loop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-manager-console-setup&quot;&gt;Stage Manager Console Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up a second Decimator with SDI-in taken from the Amp Room SDI run (on the floor, a shelf, or table is fine as long as the cables aren’t a trip hazard).
Connect power to the Decimator, and send HDMI-out to Crestron panel’s HDMI-in using the second HDMI cable. Enter Technician Mode at Crestron panel (5540) and route “SM Input” to Lower Lobby, Auditorium, Theater East, and Theater West for overflow viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&amp;lt;-SDI-in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theater-eastwest&quot;&gt;Theater East/West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carefully remove the Decoder box from below the TV in either Theater West or Theater East. Make sure the disconnected cables are stable and accessible for reconnection during strike.
(When restoring these, take care with cable/port matches: Yellow Component cable -&amp;gt; Yellow Component output, Black/Silver Audio cable -&amp;gt; Red audio output)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mezzanine&quot;&gt;Mezzanine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the ethernet cable to left port (the right port is disconnected) of ethernet #243 (located in the office to the right when you walk in) and connect the other end to “Primary” on the Decoder box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug in power for the TV, and plug the DC-Adapter into an outlet and connect it to the Decoder box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run Component-outs from the Decoder to Component-ins on back of TV.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on TV and set to Component source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run HDMI-out from the Decoder to HDMI-in on back of TV using the third HDMI cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The following must be done quickly using the decoder remote:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;select 1080i-out on Decoder&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;switch TV source to HDMI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hit accept/confirm on Decoder remote&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Grand Tutorial</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/grand-curtain-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/grand-curtain-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-the-grand-is&quot;&gt;What the Grand Is&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Grand Curtain is a manually operated dual curtain system used to cut the
stage (usually very far downstage) in order to create dramatic opening and
finale effects.
It consists of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) batton mounted frames, one upstage, one downstage, which support three of the four pulleys,
 and support the track on which the curtain carriers run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four (4) pulleys, three of which reside on the frame pieces, and one of which lives on the ground during operation of the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fifty-six (56) single curtain carriers. One single curtain carrier lives at the offstage end of each frame piece, closest to the pulley.
The remaining 54 single carriers are evenly distributed on the tracks of each of the frame pieces, and support and enable the movement of the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Single Carrier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) master curtain carriers. One master carrier lives on each track as the furthest on-stage carrier, after all the single carriers have been placed.
The master carriers serve to clamp the rope to segment it into two pieces, which is essential for the proper operation of the curtain. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Master Carrier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four (4) end stops. Two of these live towards the offstage ends of the carrier track, and two of these live at the onstage ends of the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;End Stop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One (1) rope. The rope forms a loop that connects through all the curtain carriers and pulleys and (ideally, if the curtain is set up correctly)
  permits the opening and closing of the Grand Curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) curtains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-the-grand-works&quot;&gt;How the Grand Works&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most important concepts to comprehend in order to understand the operation of the Grand are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The free/restricted movement of the curtain carriers on the track&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movement of the rope through the pulleys and how this influences the movement of the curtain carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-rope&quot;&gt;On the Rope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When set up properly, the rope forms a giant loop that connects through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The pulley on the floor (from where the curtain is operated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage stage left vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stage right horizontal pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The pulley on the floor to complete the loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rope is divided into two segments via clamping at the two master carriers. One of these segments consists of everything that is &lt;strong&gt;stage left&lt;/strong&gt;
of the downstage master carrier that the rope comes in contact with, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage single carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ground pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope between the upstage vertical pulley and the upstage master carrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other segment consists of everything that is effectively &lt;strong&gt;stage right&lt;/strong&gt; of the downstage master carrier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope between the downstage master carrier and the stage right horizontal pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stage right horizontal pulley itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage single curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage master curtain carrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The segmentation / clamping at the master carriers is one of the integral parts of the movement of the curtain.
If not for this, the rope would just move mostly unimpeded through the single carriers and the curtain would not move along with the rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this importance, it is pertinent to have the proper lengths of rope in each segment,
and the proper amount of slack distributed between the segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When initially setting up the rope, you must size the rope lengths to the stage right segment. The stage left segment is slightly more
flexible in terms of the acceptable range of rope length and permittable slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-movement-of-the-rope&quot;&gt;The Movement of the Rope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the rope is clamped at the two master carriers, pulling on one of the two vertical segments of rope from the floor position
either closes or opens the curtain. This works because the rope is fixed at the master carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you imagine a position at upstage center to be 12 o clock, closing the curtain moves the rope and the carriers clockwise around the loop, and opening the curtain moves the
rope/carriers counterclockwise around the loop. The master carriers are hooked to the onstage edges of the curtain. The single carriers are hooked onto the rest of the grommets with the most offstage grommet hooked to a carrier that is secured behind a bracket on the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the curtain is closed and the master carriers are pulled onstage the master carriers will pull the curtain edges taught and cause the single carriers to pseudo-follow the rope as they follow the grommets on the curtain to which they are connected as the curtain is gradually pulled taught. When the curtain is opened the master carriers will be pulled offstage and will collide with the single carriers, pulling them offstage with it. This will pull the curtain along with the grommets similar to the action when closing the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you hopefully understand the movement of the curtain, let’s tell you how to actually build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-the-curtain&quot;&gt;Building the Curtain&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First gather the parts and tools you’ll need. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The single and master curtain carriers
&lt;br /&gt;   These live in a plastic bin in the stage right upstage wing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope - Lives in another plastic bin by the bin for the carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crescent wrenches - Live in Janice on one of the lower-ish shelves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patience - Find it inside yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly in U2, assuming the frame for the Grand is still built out on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;placing-the-curtain-carriers-on-the-track&quot;&gt;Placing the Curtain Carriers on the Track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is remove the end stops from the onstage ends of the track.
You’re doing this in order to place the curtain carriers on the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the end stops are off, place twenty-seven (27) single carriers on each track.
These need to be placed so that the fold guides are pointing downstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the single carriers are all placed, count them again to make sure you have 27 on each side,
then place one master carrier on each track, these should be oriented so that the metal posts on the downstage
master carriers point downstage, and so that the posts on the upstage master carrier point upstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the carriers are all in place, check again to make sure you have the proper number of carriers on each track,
then replace and re-secure the end stops at the onstage ends of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the end stops are in place you can begin to thread the rope through the pulleys and carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;threading-the-rope&quot;&gt;Threading the Rope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin by threading the rope through the floor pulley. With the pulley placed on the floor and the knob facing stage left and you,
thread the rope through the gap in the top on the right hand side, staying between the pulley and the bar. Continue feeding the rope along
the wheel, staying inside the posts, until you can bring the rope up out the other side of the gap at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feed the end of the rope that you pulled through the left side of the gap through the downstage, stage left vertical pulley.
With this pulley, (and with its upstage cousin later on) take the rope up and outside the bottom bar, then feed it along the
wheel and the inside of the posts until you can come out the onstage gap that leads to the curtain carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through that pulley, feed it through the big holes of the downstage single carriers, starting with the one closest to the vertical pulley
(this is stage left of the offstage endstop and may be hard to see, as it’s very close to the pulley). Feed the rope through all the big holes on the single carriers one after the other, making sure not to skip any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve finished threading the downstage single carriers, skip the downstage master carrier for now, and pull the rope to the stage right horizontal pulley.
Thread through the stage right horizontal pulley. Feed the rope through the inner gap, around the wheel, again, staying on the inside of the bar in the back. However,
once you’re around the back and the rope is along the wheel, skip going back through the inner gap and feed the rope through the offstage single carrier’s hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stage Right Pulley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feed through the rest of the upstage single carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through all the single carriers, pull the master carrier to the onstage end of the track. Now pull the rope so that you have about a foot and a half of slack at the master carrier at the end of the track. Push the rope into the gap between the metal posts of the master carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have someone go to the downstage master carrier and pull it as far onstage as it will go. Have the upstage person
hold their end of the rope, and have the downstage person pull the rope towards stage left so the rope is taught. With the rope taught,
or mostly taught, place the rope into the gap between the metal posts on the downstage master carrier, leaving a little slack,  and clamp the rope in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can feed the stage left part of the rope (the end that isn’t the one you’ve been working with this whole time) through the upstage vertical pulley,
like you did before with the other one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through the pulley pull that end of the rope to the upstage master carrier. Pull it so that you have about the same amount of slack on that end as on the other end, shove both ends into the gap in the metal posts and clamp them tightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Upstage Master Carrier Slack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rope is secured to the master carriers, you can start hanging the curtain on the hooks hanging from the carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hanging-the-curtain&quot;&gt;Hanging the Curtain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dump each side of the curtains on their respective side of the stage, and unroll them enough so that you can hang them on the hooks.
You should bring all the carriers back to the offstage ends. Make sure the labeled side of the curtain is facing upstage, and start
hooking the hooks to the grommets on the curtain. The farthest offstage grommet hooks onto the single carrier that is ‘anchored’ offstage,
and the furthest onstage grommet hooks onto the hooks of the master carrier. There should be exactly as many hooks from the single and master carriers
as there are grommets on the curtain. Once all the hooks are attached to the grommets, you’re good to fly the Grand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you fly it out, have someone watch the slack by the floor pulley and feed it so that it doesn’t catch on itself. If you’re able to fly the curtain all the way out
without picking up the pulley, you’re in luck you got the rope lengths mostly right on your first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try running the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can close the curtain and open it somewhat easily then congratulations!
You just built out what has historically been the most frustrating piece of equipment we own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the stage right segment of rope is at the proper tension and length&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you’ve left off the fold guides of the single carriers. These are the small holes on the little brackets that are connected by a small chain to the single carriers. In previous (incorrect) configurations of the Grand, the rope used to be threaded through these. This is no longer the case, as they seem to serve only to impede the movement of the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the rope isn’t caught around the floor pulley. If it is you probably have too much slack on the stage left segment. Pull more through the upstage master carrier and reclamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;striking-the-grand&quot;&gt;Striking the Grand&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much just take everything apart that you set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unclamp the ropes from the master carriers.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Re-attach the clamping bracket after the rope is off.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove and reserve the end stops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the rope out of the carriers and pulleys (if the stage is bare, try and keep it off the wood)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take all the carriers (except the ones anchored offstage) off the tracks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The best / most fun way is to hold a bin at the end off the track and just push them off the track into the bin&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the End Stops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the rope is somewhat neatly in the bin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;folding-the-curtains&quot;&gt;Folding the curtains&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folding the curtains is easier to get wrong then you may think, and if you get it wrong you may not be able to fit the curtain in its bin,
which, writing from experience is extremely frustrating at the end of a long strike call. Thankfully it’s also easy to fold properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin by laying the curtain out flat (or as flat as it will get with its pleats).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull the bottom corners taught, then the top corners.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the center seam is relatively straight between the top and bottom of the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the curtain is laid out, you can fold it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have one person at one top corner and one person at the bottom corner of the same side. Together you’ll fold the curtain from one edge to the center seam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run and lift the curtain in a similar manner to how you would fold any other of our soft goods (try to catch air).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that your fold aligns nicely with the seam, and make sure the fold is about as flat as it can be, not overlapping on itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve checked that, fold the other side similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the other side is folded, you’re going to fold from the outside edges to the center again, similar to what you just did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Twice Folded&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve completed the second fold to the center, you’re going to take one side and fold it over the center line to the seam on the other side.
The best way to do this is to get like four or so people to just pick the whole side up and place it across to the seam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take the edge of the other side and fold it to the edge of the side you just folded (so over on itself). Once it’s all folded, roll from the bottom to the top.
The roll will be pretty thick, but it should fit nicely in the bin. Once that’s done, repeat the process for the other curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, thank the Grand for its service and celebrate being done with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, party.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting Up monitors</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-monitors.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-monitors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The basic idea here is that you’re sending a certain mix of sounds back to the musicians so they can hear themselves better or other instruments that might be too quiet or far away for them to hear otherwise. This mix is, more often than not, different from the house mix that the audience hears. You are sending audio from a channel to an auxiliary output on the Venue (a separate output from the mains), which goes to the patchbay, then to a floorbox or AVP, then to a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a monitor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, figure out how many monitors will be needed by talking to the band or band leader.  Most musicians will only need one, but sometimes a drummer or lead singer will ask for two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring the monitor to stage and set it downstage of the musician who will be using it. Take a look at the direction the speakers inside are facing and try to point them toward the musician’s face. If you are using a Community M12 stage monitor, the square speaker (behind the grill) should be on the side closest to the musician.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a SpeakOn cable with enough length to reach between the monitor and the nearest floorbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect either end of the cable to the floorbox (or AVP) Speakon output that you intend to use (just pick one, they’re all the same) and remember that number for patching.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attach the other end of the speakon to the monitor itself. If there are two identical ports on the back of the monitor, one of them will be your input (usually the one on the left) and the other can be used to daisy chain a second monitor to this one.  However, if you forget which side is which, it does NOT matter; both ports are completely identical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: when plugging in Speakon cable, make sure you push in the end, then twist it clockwise UNTIL IT LOCKS. These cords carry a lot of power, so it’s important that they are correctly fastened. To unlock, simply pull back the grey portion near the end and turn counterclockwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move to the Patchbay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will be working in the Speakon patchbay in the rack furthest to the right. They are labeled properly, so just think about what you are trying to do and re-check your output # if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aux sends are split in the patchbay, so Aux #1 now has two outputs. Take a CROSSWIRED speakon cable, plug one end into the correct Venue aux output, and plug the other end into the corresponding floorbox/AVP port.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, you can now head back up to the board.  Find an assistant to confirm that each monitor is working. Then adjust the mix for each monitor as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up at the Venue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll first need to “set up” an aux in order to send signal from the board to the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up an aux, first “select” the channel on the board that is holding your signal. That signal could be the microphone on stage, talkback mic at FOH, or from the channel holding your ipod.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Better yet, use the signal generator found in the Options/Miscellaneous tab and insert it by first turning the OUTPUT VOLUME to -inf dB. Click the volume control to turn it on, selecting the output that you wish to test (using the Select buttons on the Venue desk), and ONLY THEN turning up the volume on the signal Generator.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The speakers in the Hall can produce Sound Pressure Levels that can permanently damage someones hearing even at a distance; always ensure that the volume is low before engaging the generator so as to ensure that we don’t deafen each other!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your signal ready and showing strength, select that channel and look on screen and find the “aux” section of the channel strip (it should be toward the top, just left of center). It will have 16 numbered round knobs. Click on the rotary knob (it will turn green) to turn it on, then adjust the rotary knob to your desired level.  Always start low and work your way up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you’ve just sent the channel signal to the aux send, but you still need to send the aux send signal to the stage monitor itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do that, look over to the group of faders designated for sends on the board. It’s the group of 8 faders just left of the master fader.  Make sure you have selected the button labeled “Aux 1-8” so that you are in the right fader bank. Then, move the Aux #1 fader up to unity, or another good level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a good time to decide whether you want this aux to be pre- or post-fade.  Unless you have a valid reason to select otherwise, choose post-fade. This will give you the control of using the aux fader to boost or cut overall signal to that monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Base your levels and EQ solely on the feedback you get from your assistant on stage or the musician listening to it. From 100’ away, you have no clue what it sounds like. Talk to this person in depth to get a feel for how it sounds and how you could make it sound better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Setting Up a DI-Box</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-a-di-box.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-a-di-box</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A DI-Box (Direct Input Box) allows you to connect high-impedance sources to a mixer without adverse effects.
The most common uses are for connecting electric keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and most forms of instrument pickups directly to the mixer without using an amp or microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the 1⁄4” TS cable from the instrument’s pick up into the DI (using the high-Z input)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug an XLR into the output of the DI and run that to a system input (floorbox, AVP, snake, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an amp is involved, but they still want a direct line as well, you’ll have to split the source.
Usually the musician will have his/her instrument plugged directly into the amp, so you’ll have to break this chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull the plug from the amp input and insert it into either input of your DI box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab a short instrument cable (1/4 inch TS usually) and plug into the THRU port of the DI and then back into the input of the amp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Getting Sound From a Mic to the mains</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/mic-to-mains.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/mic-to-mains</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-mic&quot;&gt;##Setting up a Mic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find out who or what you are miking and how versatile they need to be during the show. Choose a
stand and mic accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find out where the mic needs to be placed on stage. Setup the stand, attach the clip, and slip the
mic into the clip. Make sure everything within the stand is tight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the mic is wired and you are using a boom stand,
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take your XLR cable and first plug the male end into the floorbox or AVP.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carry the coil to the stand (when possible, follow along with other cables going in that same
direction) and drop the coil under the center of the stand.
￼￼￼￼￼* Run the female end up the stand, wrapping it around once.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As you hit the boom, make sure the cord runs over the tightening pin.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wrap the cord once more around the boom in the same direction.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plug the female end into the mic, making sure the cord has enough slack at the end so that
the mic can be easily adjusted, but not so much that the cord is hanging all over.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always leave the cable slack at the base of the mic stand, never at the input or somewhere in
between.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to run the cables in right angles when possible and along with other cables nearby. However,
avoid running microphone cables alongside AC power cables or SpeakOn unless absolutely
necessary;; this will generate noise in the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any loose cables onstage or backstage should be taped down after soundcheck is complete, and
prior to doors opening. Remember to not tape down any mics that will need to move around during
the show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the mic is wireless, check to make sure the battery has at least two bars for a rehearsal setting
and three for a public performance. Batteries with less than two bars should be recycled in the
“dead battery” bin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-patchbay&quot;&gt;##The Patchbay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where you will be connecting the signal directly to the SC48. Check the number on the floorbox or AVP input you plug into;; it should be in the format of the letter M then a sequence of ascending numbers, example: M12. Take a long-frame cable and run it from that input to whichever channel you intend to use on the mixing board. Use different colored cables to show different groups of mics (wired vs wireless or vocals vs instruments or input to split to SC48 vs booth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While patching, make sure the sound system is on by checking that the sequencer key is turned to “on” and that all its associated amps have turned on. While you’re doing this, check the subwoofer amp and turn on manually if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-the-venue-sc48&quot;&gt;##At the Venue SC48&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn on the Venue if it hasn’t been turned on yet. Once it is on, make sure all channels have been
muted or have their faders turned down. Then turn the master fader (at the far right) up to “unity”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select each channel you have patched mics to and label them by double clicking on the “Channel #”
in the top left corner of the onscreen interface and naming what instrument or type of mic it is (“SL Vox” for stage left vocals, or “W1” for wireless mic #1). This makes it easier to keep track of your mics and keeps you from forgetting which channels are which.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are using a condenser mic, remember to mute the channel before turning on phantom power because the 48 volts will cause the mike to pop momentarily. If the mic is not muted, the entire house may hear an very loud and unpleasant sound. To engage phantom power:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Select the channel that needs the phantom.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Again, make sure the channel is MUTED and the fader is down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Press the 48V button near the top of the Venue.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unmute, gain and then fader up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find someone assigned as or willing to temporarily be your audio assistant to test the mics. Have them first go to each mic and test that each one is working by gently tapping the grill of the mic. You are checking to see that you are getting signal to the channel;; if you see nothing, turn up the gain until you do. Remember to keep the channel muted and fader down while line checking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have completed the line check, you know all your patches are correct, and you have extra time and want to do things right, you can now do your pre-soundcheck soundcheck! Ask your assistant to go back to each mic and spend more time with each one. They should speak through vocal mic and play approved instruments, one at a time, to help you set gains and test monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During line check, confirm that each channel is going to the appropriate main speaker (LR or C). To do this, decide whether the sound from each independent channel should be coming out of the left and right speakers, the center speaker, or all three. * As a rule, vocalists should be routed to the center speaker only, instruments to the left and right and pre-recorded music again to just left and right (although left, center, and right is also an option if you need more level). On the board, select the channel, then choose the L/R or Center assigns from the master mains routing section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adjust the panning, limiter, comps, gate and effects (FX) as you see fit. These should all be adjusted pre-show;; turning any of these on mid-show would have to be done very gradually and strategically. When done improperly, you could lose sound completely and totally throw off a performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double check that the speakers are at the the right height for the show.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For a lecture or panel, the center speaker can be the only one down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Instrumental performances can have the left and right speakers down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For use with the projection screen, left and right should be set below the break in the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For a film screening from the booth, fly the line array below the break in the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the basic loop of mic to patchbay to Venue to speakers is complete. There are a bunch of technical processes in there, but basic mic amplification is taking place, which can be enough for some musical performances and most lecture settings.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/handheld-tascam-tutorial</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-set-up&quot;&gt;Initial Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press and hold the Home button to turn on the Tascam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the battery indicator and replace if the battery is low.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to see if the SD card is actually in the device; if not, find one and insert it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-the-memory-to-ensure-theres-enough-space-for-your-recording&quot;&gt;Empty the memory to ensure there’s enough space for your recording:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press menu button to get to the menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use plus or minus buttons to scroll down to others, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to system, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to quick format, press enter.  Exec, enter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“All data erased. Are you sure?” Press enter and you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press menu to get back to the record screen and press the Rec Mode button to choose an input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay in “stereo” and then select your input under “source”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source will be either “Internal microphone” or “External in 1&amp;amp;2” (your XLR 1&amp;amp;2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing menu again will bring you back to the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-three-methods-of-taking-a-recording-in-the-penthouse&quot;&gt;There are three methods of taking a recording in the Penthouse:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to test it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp;amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, send the file to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;erinbrenner@uchicago.edu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording to the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter Erin’s email address (above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your email address press Send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If a group decides they would like a video recording of their event and has hired someone to do so, they may ask for an audio feed from the board. This videographer will probably be doing post production and wants direct raw mic feeds as opposed to using the distance mic on his camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method for setting up a feed mirroring the board output would be similar to sending audio to a monitor, except that rather than sending the audio to the patchbay, you will be sending it directly to the video camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, run an XLR cord from one of the auxiliary outputs on the back of the board to the videographer. You may have to unplug one of the eight auxiliary outputs; remember to plug them back in after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the cord stays behind the chairs in the house and is taped down whenever it has to cross an aisle or walkway; if crossing an aisle, tape the XLR at the bottom of the steps where no one is likely to trip on it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If running a feed to the lower level, use very long cables and daisy chain two or more together;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Run them from the mixer ➝ straight out to the wall ➝ down the wall to the lower level ➝ back in to where the video is positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never run cable across a walkway and make sure they don’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the connection has been made, you will want to send the videographer a test signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select the aux you will be using (i.e. Aux #8), then use the mouse to click on System, then find the test signals sending a 100 Hz, 1000 Hz, 10000 Hz, White Noise, or Pink Noise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase the level of sound until the videographer confirms he/she is receiving signal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have confirmed that the camera is receiving signal, ask the videographer what kind of mix he/she would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say the videographer wants the house mix; you would need to send all of the audio at the same level as it is coming out of the mains, so you would select all of the channels that will potentially be going live during the event and send them at unity, postfade, to Aux #8, and then raise Aux #8 to unity as well, or to whatever level the videographer decides is best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not adjust the aux level during the show, as it will make everything suddenly sound louder or softer mid-recording.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the videographer asks for only vocal mics or instrument mics, select the correct channels and send them to the correct aux.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases the videographer may choose to do his/her own post-production sound editing, and may want a specific prefade mix. In this case, ask what they are looking for, and adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that sending a channel prefade means the aux will receive signal when the channel fades out, but not when the channel is muted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

—&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/D Converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Analog to digital converter, a device that transforms incoming analog signals into digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for After Fade Listen, another way of saying post-fader solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Send:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer bus output designed to send a signal to an auxiliary processor or monitor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer input with limited control capabilities, intended for bringing the output of an auxiliary processor or other line-level source into the main mix bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Input:&lt;/strong&gt; An input consists of two leads, neither of which is common to the circuit ground. This is a “differential pair”, where the signal consists of the difference in voltage between the two leads. Balanced input circuits can offer excellent rejection of common-mode noise induced into the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Output:&lt;/strong&gt; In a classic balanced audio circuit, the output is carried on two leads (high/+ and low/-) which are isolated from the circuit ground by exactly the same impedance. A symmetrical balanced output carries the same signal at exactly the same level but of opposite polarity with respect to ground. A special case of a balanced output carries the signal on only one lead, with the other lead being at zero voltage with respect to ground, but at the same impedance as the signal-carrying lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;: The band of frequencies that pass through a device with a loss of less than 3dB, expressed in Hertz or in musical octaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardioid:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart-shaped. In sound work, cardioid refers to the shape of the sensitivity vs. direction plot for a particular style of directional microphone. A cardioid mic rejects sound arriving from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel:&lt;/strong&gt; A functional path in an audio circuit: an input channel, an output channel, a recording channel, the left channel and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel strip:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical realization of an audio channel on the front panel of a mixer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipping:&lt;/strong&gt; A form of severe audio distortion that results from peaks of the audio signal attempting to rise above the capabilities of the amplifier circuit. To avoid clipping, reduce the system gain in or before the gain stage in which the clipping occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressor:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a dynamic processor used to smooth out any large transient peaks in an audio signal that might otherwise overload your system or cause distortion. The amplitude threshold and other parameters such as attack time, release time, and ratio are adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condenser:&lt;/strong&gt; Condenser microphones require electrical power to run internal amplifiers and maintain an electrical charge on the capacitor. They are typically powered by internal batteries or “phantom power” supplied by an external source, such as a mixing console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cueing:&lt;/strong&gt; In broadcast, stage and post-production work, to “cue up” a sound or video source (a record, a sound effect on a CD, a song on a tape) means to get it ready for playback by making sure you are in the right position on the “cue,” making sure the level and EQ are all set properly. This requires a special monitoring circuit that only the mixing engineer hears. It does not go out on the air or to the main mixing buses. Cueing can also refer to a similar process regarding video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D/A converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital-to-analog converter, a device that transforms incoming digital signal into analog form.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decibel (dB):&lt;/strong&gt; A unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound work, delay usually refers to an electronic circuit or effects unit whose purpose it is to delay the audio signal for some short period of time. Delay can refer to one short repeat, a series of repeats or the complex interactions of delay used in chorusing or reverb. When delayed signals are mixed back with the original sound, a great number of audio effects can be generated, including phasing and flanging, doubling, Haas precedence-effect panning, slap or slapback, echo, regenerative echo, chorusing and hall-like reverberation. Signal time delay is central to many audio effects units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually means without reverberation, or without some other applied effect like delay or chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic microphone:&lt;/strong&gt; The class of microphones that generate electrical signals by the movement of a coil in a magnetic field. Dynamic microphones are rugged, relatively inexpensive, capable of very good performance and do not require external power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equalization (EQ):&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to purposefully changing the frequency response of a circuit, sometimes to correct for previous unequal response (hence the term, equalization), and more often to boost or cut the level at certain frequencies for sound enhancement, to remove extraneous sounds, or to create completely new and different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of times an event repeats itself in a given period of time. The audio frequency range is generally considered to be 20 Hz to 20, 000 Hz. This covers the fundamental pitch and most overtones of musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; The measure of how much a circuit amplifies a signal. Gain may be stated as a ratio of input to output voltage, current or power, such as a voltage gain of 4, or a power gain of 1.5, or it can be expressed in decibels, such as a line amplifier with a gain of 10dB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate:&lt;/strong&gt; A dynamics processor that automatically turns off an input signal when it drops below a certain level. This can reduce the overall noise level of your mix by turning off inputs when they are not in use. Threshold, attack time, hold, and release time are some of the adjustable gate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A graphic equalizer uses slide pots for its boost/cut controls, with its operating frequencies evenly spaced through the audio spectrum. In a perfect world, a line drawn through the centers of thecontrol shafts would form a graph of the frequency response curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; Also called earth. Ground is defined as the point of zero voltage in a circuit or system, the reference point from which all other voltages are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In electrical power systems, ground connections are used for safety purposes, to keep equipment chassis and controls at zero voltage and to provide a safe path for errant currents. This is called a safety ground. Maintaining a good safety ground is essential to prevent electrical shock.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In sensitive electronic equipment, tiny currents and voltages riding on the ground (so it’s not truly zero volts) can cause noise in the circuits and hamper operation. Often a ground separate from the power ground is used as the reference point for the electronics, isolating the sensitive electronics from the dirty power ground. This is called a technical ground.
Hertz: The unit of frequency, equal to 1 cycle per second. Abbreviated Hz. kHz = 1000 Hz, and is usually pronounced “kay” (with “Hertz” implied) by sound professionals who ask for “a little more two and a half K” when they want you to boost 2.5 kHz (2500Hz).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impedance:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure of the AC resistance, capacitance, and inductance in an electrical circuit, measured in ohms;; all of these three properties impede the flow of current. AKA: the higher the impedance, the lower the current. In audio circuits (and other AC circuits) the impedance in ohms can often be much different from the circuit resistance as measured by a DC ohmmeter. Maintaining proper circuit impedance relationships is important to avoid distortion and minimize added noise.
Level: Another word for signal voltage, power, strength or volume. Audio signals are sometimes classified according to their level. Commonly used levels are: microphone level (-40 dBu or lower), instrument level (-20 to -10 dBu), and line level (-10 to +30 dBu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;￼￼￼￼￼&lt;strong&gt;Line level:&lt;/strong&gt;  A signal whose level falls between -10 dBu and +30 dBu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main (house) speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; The main loudspeakers for a sound reinforcement system. These are usually the largest and loudest loudspeakers, and are usually positioned so that their sound seems to come from the area of the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master:&lt;/strong&gt; A control affecting the final output of a bus on which one or more signals are mixed. A mixer may have several master controls, which may be slide faders or rotary controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic level:&lt;/strong&gt; The typical level of a signal from a microphone. A mic level signal (usually but not always coming from a microphone) is generally lower than -30 dBu. With a very quiet source (a pin dropping?) the signal can be -70 dBu or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic preamp:&lt;/strong&gt; Short for microphone preamplifier. An amplifier whose job is to bring the very low microphone level signal up to line level, or in the case of a mic preamp built into a mixer, the mixer’s internal operating level (approximately 0 dBu). Mic preamps often have their own volume control, called a trim control, to properly set the gain for a particular source. Setting the mic preamp gain correctly with the trim control is an essential step in establishing good signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient headroom for your mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound reinforcement, monitor speakers (or monitor headphones or in-the-ear monitors) are
those speakers used by the performers to hear themselves. In recording, the monitor speakers are those used by the engineer and production staff to listen to the recording as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever you don’t want to hear. Could be hum, buzz or hiss;; could be crosstalk or digital hash or your neighbor’s stereo;; could be white noise or pink noise or brown noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; A wiring method which electrically ties together two jacks or two poles of one jack so that in normal operation, there is signal flow between them. Inserting a plug breaks this connection, allowing the signal path to be modified. Normal wiring is common in patchbays and insert jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PA:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Public Address. An electronic amplification system used as a communication system in public areas. Today, people who work with PA systems like to say they’re working in “sound reinforcement”. Pan, pan pot: Short for panoramic potentiometer. A pan pot is used to position (or even dynamically move) a monaural sound source in a stereo mixing field by adjusting the source’s volume between the left and right channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch bay:&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of usually a large number of jacks allowing convenient access to various points in a system’s interconnect wiring. A patch bay can make re-routing signals very convenient without having to fish around with cables in the back of racks or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parametric EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A “fully” parametric EQ is an extremely powerful equalizer that allows smooth, continuous, and independent control of each of the three primary EQ parameters: frequency, gain, and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for Pre Fade Listen. Sound folks call it being able to solo a channel with the fader down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Power:&lt;/strong&gt; A system of providing electrical power for condenser microphones (and some electronic pickup devices) from the microphone input jack;; it provides +48V across two pins in a 3-pin XLR. The system is called phantom because the power is carried on standard microphone audio wiring in a way that is “invisible” to ordinary dynamic microphones. Generally, phantom power is safe to use with non-condenser microphones as well, especially dynamic microphones. However, unbalanced microphones, some electronic equipment (such as some wireless microphone receivers) and some ribbon microphones can short out the phantom power and be severely damaged. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; The time relationship between two signals, expressed in degrees around a circle. 0 and 360 degrees represents an in-phase relationship – both signals change in the same way at the same time. Anything else
is out of phase. 180 degrees out of phase is a special case which, for a continuous waveform, means that at any given time the two signals have the same amplitude but are opposite in polarity. The phase reverse switch found on some mixers or mic preamps actually reverses the signal polarity. When out-of-phase signals are mixed, there will be some cancellation at certain frequencies, the frequencies and the degree of cancellation being a function of the amount of phase shift and the relative amplitude of the signals. Attention to mic placement and careful listening will allow you to use this effect creatively.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is not affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A return is a mixer line input dedicated to the task of returning processed or added sound from reverb, echo and other effects devices. Depending on the internal routing of your mixer and your own inclination, you could use returns as additional line inputs, or you could route your reverb outputs to ordinary line inputs rather than the returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverb:&lt;/strong&gt; The sound remaining in a room after the source of sound is stopped. Reverberation and echo are terms that are often used interchangeably, but in audio parlance a distinction is usually made: reverberation is considered to be a diffuse, continuously smooth decay of sound, whereas echo is one or more distinct, recognizable repetitions of a word, note, phrase or sound which decreases in amplitude with every repeat. Highly reverberant rooms are called live;; rooms with very little reverberation are called dead. A sound source without added reverb is dry;; one with reverb or echo added is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal-to-noise ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a specification that describes how much noise an audio component has compared to the signal. It is usually expressed in dB below a given output level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surround sound:&lt;/strong&gt; Multi-channel audio playback systems in 6, 8, or 10-channel formats. Surround sound is typically found in movie theaters and home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Ring-Sleeve, the three parts of a two-conductor (plus shield) phone plug. Since the plug or jack can carry two signals and a common ground, TRS connectors are often referred to as stereo or balanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Sleeve, the two parts of a single conductor (plus shield) phone plug. TS connectors are sometimes called mono or unbalanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbalanced:&lt;/strong&gt; An electrical circuit in which the two legs of the circuit do not have the identical impedance to ground. Often one leg is also at ground potential. Unbalanced circuit connections require only two conductors (signal “hot” and ground). Unbalanced audio circuitry is less expensive to build, but under certain circumstances is more susceptible to noise pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Audio Equipment and Set-Up</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/equipment-and-setup.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/audio-equipment-and-setup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;stands--safety&quot;&gt;###Stands &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall has two basic types of stands: boom stands and straight stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight stands:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Given that they are less versatile than boom stands, straight stands are generally used to hold microphones for vocal performance or speaking. We usually use straight stands for wireless mics because they are easier to move around the stage, but they can take any standard mic clip. Our straight stands have a heavy round base and an adjustable neck. The connector at the neck twists right to tighten and left to loosen;; adjust the stand to the appropriate height and tighten the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boom stands:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Given that they can be contorted into good positions for picking up sounds from many different instruments (including drums, strings, brass, woodwinds, etc), boom stands are more adept for miking instruments. When using a wired mic on a boom stand, the cable should be wrapped a couple of times across the length of the boom, over the pin, and down the length of the stand. Do not wrap the cord too many times;; just enough to keep it from flailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Each time you want to make a change to a stand, loosen one joint, adjust the length/direction, tighten and move on to the next joint until the stand acts how you want it to and will hold the weight of the mic you’re about to put on it. Pay attention to how the legs are aligned when you position the stand. If the stand seems unstable, position it so that one of it’s legs is directly under the boom arm. Make sure every joint is tight before walking away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disassembling, also remember to work with one joint at a time. It is very easy to get your fingers
￼￼￼pinched between the moving parts, so be very careful when adjusting and always tighten! The goal when disassembling, is to minimize the space it takes up, so shorten all lengths and align all arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cables&quot;&gt;###Cables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall uses XLR, TRS, Mini TRS, SpeakOn, Cross-wired SpeakOn, Ethernet and Longframe patchbay cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XLR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequently used cord in the hall for passing audio signal. Three-pin XLR cords are able to pass a balanced signal that travels farther than unbalanced signal. Generally XLR cords run from a wired microphone and into Floorboxes, AV panels off-stage (AVPs), or to a snake.
The hall has 10’, 25’, and 50’ XLR, stored on the bottom shelf of the backstage cabinet. When running cable from a mic to a floorbox input, you should look at the length from the stand to the input and choose a cable length that will give you a few feet of slack, as performers may move the stands during soundcheck and occasionally midshow. Leave the slack at the base of the mic stand and not near the input location or somewhere in between.
If the stands will be in the same place during the whole show, you should tape down all the cables in order to create a safer walking space for the performers and a cleaner look for the audience. When taping on stage use the brown gaff tape;; it will blend into the wood and make the stage look cleaner. Any backstage cable taping should be in black gaff as it is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1⁄4” TRS Instrument Cable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as 1⁄4” cable, “tip, ring, sleeve” or instrument cable. We don’t stock a variety of lengths in the hall because musicians typically bring their own. We do own a few shorter patch length 1⁄4” cables that could run from an amp, keyboard or an instrument with a pick-up to a DI box. These are kept in the storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini TRS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as 1⁄8”, 3.5mm or aux cable, are commonly used audio cables for connecting phones, ipods and computers to an audio system. While these devices normally have an 1⁄8” input, you often need to convert it to an XLR or 1⁄4” output when connecting to a mixer. In the hall we have a TRS 1⁄8” to stereo XLR cable connected to the mixer at FOH for device connection, but we keep a spare in the storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpeakOn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used for running sound to floor wedges/monitors, usually from Floorboxes or AVPs. SpeakOn cables vary in length, so choose the appropriate length for each monitor. Floor Monitors that use a SpeakOn input usually will not require any external power;; all the monitors we have are “passive” and therefore do not require any external AC power adaptor. SpeakOn is stored on the audio shelf next to the backstage cabinet.
Crosswired SpeakOn: ONLY used in the patchbay for connecting Venue outputs to the appropriate floorbox or AVP connections. These cords are about 2.5’ and stay in the amp room at all times;; they are marked CROSS on the neck of the cable.
Long-frame/Military cords [Patchbay cords]: Green, red, and black cable used in the patchbay to connect mic inputs to the Venue or Recording Booth. Also used to split signal when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coiling-cables&quot;&gt;###Coiling Cables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two methods for coiling an XLR cable and there is much debate as to which is better. In the hall, we use the “over/under” method. This same method can be used to coil almost all other audio cables.
￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼First, hold the female end of the cable in your left hand with the connector pointed toward you. Pull your right hand out along the cable until you reach about 18” and bring that length up into your left hand while guiding
it into becoming your first loop. Pay attention to the direction your right hand rotates as you guide the cable into making this first loop. You are about move your right hand in the exact opposite direction when making the second loop.
After grabbing this first loop in your left hand, pull another 18” with your right hand. This time you’ll loop it up under itself, by twisting in the opposite direction, and again place it in your left hand. The cable should still be moving in the same direction, away from you, it’ll just be coming in from underneath the current coil.
Continue repeating these two steps “over and under) until you hit the end of your cable. Inspect the cable for a proper coil and then use the velcro tie attached to secure. It should look like a series of same sized loops, no figure 8’s. If yours has a figure 8, you must start over. If you have both large and small loops within one coil, start over. If one of your tails is way longer than the other, fix it by adjusting the position of the velcro.
If you have a hard time getting good coils, use this video to help while practicing: http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/04/use-these-alternating-coil-methods-for-knot-free-cables/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speakers&quot;&gt;###Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as the “mains”. In the Performance Hall our mains are in a L-C-R (left, center, right) configuration. They are Electro-Voice, or “EV” brand speakers, model: Xi2123A/106, and are flown to heights controllable from the automated rigging system “Scene Control”. The projection system has its own surround sound system with a L-C-R EAW KF740 Line Array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitors:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as “wedges” or “floor wedges”. We have 3 different monitor speakers;; 3 of the smaller 12” EV’s (TX 1122 FM), 2 of the 15” EV’s (TX 1152 FM), and 2 of the 12” Community (M12’s). Monitors should be placed in front of a musician who needs to hear himself, or his fellow musicians, more clearly. While the EV’s need to be set further away from the artist because of how the speakers are pointed within the wedge, the Communities have a wider range and can be placed much closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subs:&lt;/strong&gt; We own 2 EV X-SUB’s that live in the work lofts to the left and right of downstage. The subs supply the low end frequencies to both the main and projection systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidefills:&lt;/strong&gt; The 2 side fills we have, EV Zx1’s, are built into the downstage left and right walls, just where the plank design ends. The side fills are also tied to both the main speakers and the projection audio system.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>A Guide to Laying and Striking Marley</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/26/marley-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/26/marley-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marley is a type of dance floor. It allows dancers to move easily across the deck and offers more give, resulting in higher and more efficient jumps. Marley comes in heavy vinyl strips. These strips are about four feet wide and span the length of the stage. To both lay out and strike marley, you need at least two people. Ideally, you have a crew of four: two to tape down a strip while the other two prep the next strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s marley is stored on pieces of white PVC pipe backstage right. When the flooring is down, the empty rolls can live backstage left, preferably upstage and out of the way. To lay the marley you’ll start offstage right. When rolling it back up you’ll start offstage left. The bottom of the marley will be on the outside of the roll; make sure the correct side is face up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before marley is laid out, the stage should be swept thoroughly. The Performance Hall’s marley is cut into seven panels (1 = upstage, 7 = downstage apron). Each is labeled. If for some reason you can’t find the label, relabel it using gaff tape and a sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay a marley floor you will need: marley tape, scissors/a blade, at least one buddy, knee pads (optional). While Marley tape is black like gaff tape, it is smooth and shiny in texture. Do not use gaff tape on the marley; it will leave behind a residue. When you need to cut marley tape, use scissors or a blade. Don’t try to tear the marley tape, it’s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both laying and striking the marley, the wings stage left and right should be open. The marley will lie underneath them. Be careful when sliding the marley under each panel; go too far and you’ll hit a hinge and need to readjust. Try not to cover any of the panel locking drop holes so you can still lock them into place if needed. Be aware that the Performance Hall’s stage is trapezoidal. The upstage wall is shorter than the downstage edge and the marley is cut to match this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laying-marley&quot;&gt;Laying Marley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beginning-the-process&quot;&gt;Beginning the process:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With another person, move the roll #6 of marley to the stage right, downstage corner. The rolls are very heavy, so be careful and work in a team when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to move the marley is to slowly walk the roll over on its end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip the marley onto the floor so the longer edge is downstage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the pieces of tape holding the roll together. If any tape goo is left on the marley, clean it before laying it down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unroll the marley fully by pushing the roll across the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Store the PVC pipes in the backstage left corner, upstage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With another person, align the edges of the marley with off stage walls. Once it’s even on both sides and kissing the lip, park it and tape it down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are no bubbles, tape the stage left and right sides down first. Use three pieces of tape running off stage (one upstage, one downstage and one center) to anchor both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are bubbles, tape one side down and have one person kneel on that edge to hold it in place. Have a second person on the other edge pulling toward themselves and a third person stomp across toward the second person. Once the third person has crossed the stage, the second person will tape their edge down before the third person steps off the marley.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taping-lengthwise&quot;&gt;Taping lengthwise:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start offstage right and work your way stage left as a team (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech A will hold the tape down while the Tech B creates a long stretch of slack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before touching the tape down, Tech B will stretch it taut and carefully hold it over the seam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech A will then smoothly press the tape onto the ground (moving toward Tech B) and check for any irregularity along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue this process across the length of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Techs A and B are taping Panel 6, Techs C and D should be prepping the next panel, laying the rest of the panels out in order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When securing section #7, tape slowly and try to follow the curve of the lip smoothly. If you must fold tape over the stage edge, do so, but do it neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have irregularity, fix the issue before moving on. Irregularity can create dangerous situations for dancers who are unaware of the problem. Here are some situations you would fix:
* If the marley is overlapping under the tape, either press it out or lift up and start again. A small gap between panels is better than overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a bubble in the marley itself, stomp it out in the direction you’re taping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your roll runs out of tape, cut that edge straight, tape it down and grab a new roll. Line up the new piece of tape carefully to ensure clean overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just laid your own dance floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one more thing to do before you take a break: dry sweep and mop the marley flooring. Use a bit of the Roscoe Marley Floor Cleaner in your bucket of water but nothing else. If an outside stage manager wants to use something else, ask your supervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every rehearsal or performance on marley, the stage must be swept and then mopped. Mop in smooth figure eights across the stage pulling the dirt toward you and not pushing it out away from you. Clean one strip at a time. When you’ve pulled all the dirt to one end of the stage, use the mop to pick up the dirt and deposit it into the water bucket. Do not walk on the marley until it is dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using marley alongside soft goods, always roll marley out first. When you need to sweep and mop the marley while soft goods are in, fly the goods out about a foot. This will allow you to clean the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;striking-the-marley&quot;&gt;Striking the Marley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking marley is far easier than laying it. If there are soft goods hanging that touch the floor, sweep the stage and strike the soft goods first. Then:
*Sweep and mop one last time. Wait for the marley to dry. DO NOT roll the marley up if it is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove all of your tape. (Make a giant tape ball, if you’d like! Play with it, name it, take it home, and shower it with unconditional love. Don’t shower with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collect your PVC pipes. Always roll panels stage left to stage right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting downstage left (Strip #7), tape the edge of the marley to your PVC pipe at three points; top, center and bottom (Strips #7 and #6 have unique edges that will only need one or two strips of tape to anchor them to the PVC pipe).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure you are taping the marley to the pipe in a way that will allow you to roll the marley in a straight line the entire length of the floor.  One side should always be flush with the pipe edge but not overextending over the end of the pipe edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find that you have lost sight of the pipe on your straight edge, unroll and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get to the end, make sure you still have the one exposed PVC pipe edge you’ve been working hard to maintain throughout the length of the roll.  This is the side the marley will stand on when stored upright.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it looks good and your edge is straight, you’re ready to tape the rolled up marley to itself (again top, center, and bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double check that it has not lost its label. If it has, make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand the rolled up marley in its home backstage right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DO NOT store upright unsupported by the PVC pipe with the weight on the edge of the flooring itself. This will cause the ends to bend and crease in ways that will damage the marley long term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Audio Board Operator Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/26/audio-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/26/audio-duties</id>
   <content type="html">### Before the Show

* When you arrive, uncover and turn on the Venue SC48; store the cover under the console.
* Turn on the sequencer (the key in the upper section of the left rack in the patchbay). Also, turn on the sub amp (the lower right hand section of the rack) by pressing the on button.
* Confirm with visiting artists their music, video, and whether they need any equipment.
* Set up your archival recording and test that it is getting level.
  * Always set up a backup wireless mic on a straight stand off stage left (in a place where the audience won’t see them every time the stage door opens) to easily deal with any last minute mic requests.
  * Make sure the batteries are fresh if you are about to go into a show.
  * Use half-life batteries or rechargeable batteries if you are in a rehearsal.
  * Throw dead batteries into the dead battery bin.

* **Microphones**

    * Set up requested microphones backstage and/or onstage.
    * Fly speakers in to the appropriate height based on the type of performance.
    * Fly in the banners if there will be amplified music or speaking.  Make sure you do not fly banners in front of the stage camera or the projection window if projection will be in use.
    * If using wireless mics, check all batteries and consider sleeving the mics.
    * Patch microphones in the patch bay from your “M” inputs on stage to the Venue by using the TRS cables hanging in the amp room (the red, green, and black cords).

* **Monitors**

    * Always set up monitors if someone will be singing through a microphone on stage.  Often, instrumental groups with multiple mics will want monitors in order to hear each other better.
    * Patch monitors in the speakon patchbay, from Venue outputs to stage inputs, using the short CROSSWIRED speakon cables found in the amp room only. DO NOT use regular speakon cable - they are wired differently and can damage the gear.

* **Soundcheck**

  * Before the band arrives, if possible, do a line check to make sure that each microphone and monitor is passing signal.  To line check, have your audio assistant speak into each mic, one at a time, in order to pre-set general gains. Deal with phantom needs and troubleshoot any patching issues.  Next, have your assistant stand near each monitor while you send signal, one at a time, to confirm the monitors are patched correctly.
  * It is good practice to ring out the monitors before the artists arrive as well.
  * Once the band arrives, start sound checking each mic, focusing on one instrument at a time. If you are checking drums, have the drummer go through his whole kit, one drum/cymbal at a time, while you work with the EQ, comp, gate, etc for each one.  After you have them all dialed in, ask him/her to play the whole set so that you can further tweak (pan, groups, hi-pass, etc).
  * Make sure the musician is hearing the right amount of everything through their monitor; don’t move on to the next musician until each person is happy. If they specifically ask for “everything” it’s important that you don’t give them everything.  In this situation, only give them the most important aspects for clarity’s sake (themselves, vocals, kick drum, lead guitar, whatever that might be).  If you give them everything, they’ll need more of everything and it will become a huge mess.
  * If you are mixing a digital instrument such as keyboard, dj rig or sampler, ask them to reproduce their loudest patch so that you can set your gain to that level.
  * When you finish with the last musician and everyone seems happy with their rough mixes, ask the whole group to play a half song together while you walk the room to hear the mix from different listening perspectives - tweak issues accordingly.  When the group stops playing, they will have many requests, deal with each request, one at a time.  Once everyone seems happy, ask them to try a different half song and repeat the whole process until they are happy with the stage mix and you are happy with the house mix.
  * Make sure audio cables (only cables that will stay in place for the whole show) are taped down when in high traffic walk ways - brown gaff tape onstage, black offstage.
  * Determine if there will be any videographers in house and whether or not they need a board feed. Set that up for them ahead of time.  If the videographer shows up after doors are open, you will not be able to send them a feed down to the lower level.  They will have to record from the upper level next to FOH. Make sure their power cables do not run across the house walkways.

---

### During the Show

* If you are tasked with recording the performance, remember to PRESS RECORD(!!) in the minutes leading up to the start of the show. Make sure the device is actually recording and picking up signal.
* Follow along with the program, and any notes you’ve taken, to make sure you turn the correct mic on each time someone is about to speak and then mute it when they travel off stage.
* Communicate with the stage manager, especially when mics are coming on and off the stage throughout the show so you know which mics to take live.
* Use good judgment when deciding whose mics to mute during panels and Q&amp;A’s. Sometime panelists will make a lot of noise when they aren’t speaking, so it might be good to mute their mics if someone else is speaking for a long period of time. To do this well, you will have to have all your fingers on the mutes or faders ready to pull the trigger before they decide to speak up.
* Use your headphones to solo channels in order to find any problem areas that you notice now but didn’t notice during soundcheck.
* Leave your ClearCom in a visible place so that you can see calls coming in. The stage manager may need to reach you to communicate, and without that visual you may never know.

---

### After the Show

* Mute the audio console and head down to stage to begin strike. Play some quiet music if you’d like.
* Before doing anything, attempt to troubleshoot any issues you realized during the show. Test suspect mics, cables, patches, systems, channels, etc before striking. Immediately, send an email to Erin about the problem, when it happened, how you dealt with it and the current status.  Leave the broken gear up in #243 on the secondary desk in Erin’s office.
* Strike all mics, monitors, stands and cable and restore them to their default “home” positions. Remember to keep mic clips with their mic and mic bag, not with the stand.
* Pull up all your tape from the floor.
* Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).
* Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.
* Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.
* Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.
* Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.
* If you made an archival recording:
  * In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
  * If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
* If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.
* If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.

  &lt;li&gt;Pull up all your tape from the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you made an archival recording:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Archival Recording Instructions and Standards</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/archival-instructions.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/archival-instructions</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up the Audio Console:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the board on (button on the back of the board center)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “Filing” from the options tab at the top of the display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select the “Load” tab&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you don’t have your own preset, choose “Performance Hall” folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select “Archival Recording Preset”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the button “Load”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up the Mac Mini:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the monitor display to the Mac Mini&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click on your empty desktop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “Go” in from the options tab at the top of the display&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select “Applications”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open “Microwave”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setting up your session:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the Sample Rate to 44100&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the bit depth to 24 bit&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the channels to stereo if showing mono&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click “Create”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name your session according to the naming protocol below (don’t include the .mp3)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the arrow next to the file name to drop down the filing menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the file under “Documents” -&amp;gt; “PH_Recordings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing the recording during rehearsal:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the record button to enable recording (large red circle) while making noise&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the same record button to stop recording&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you see a very slight waveform, it means your recording is working, but you want more signal&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gain the hanging house mics until you see a better waveform. Congrats! You’ve got a recording going.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drag the timing bar back to the beginning of your recording; it will allow you to record over your test&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record the show:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press Record both before and after the show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normalize, Gain, Normalize:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From the drop down menu at the top of the screen choose “Effects” then “Normalize”; allow it to process&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Next, also under “Effects”, choose “Dynamics Processor” and press “Apply” on the pop up window&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Normalize again by repeating step 1: “Effects” and “Normalize”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Choose “File” -&amp;gt; “Export”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ensure that the Output File Format is MPEG 2 Audio Layer III (.mp3) and press “OK”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Name the file the same way you named the session (according to the naming convention below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the arrow next to the file name to drop down the filing menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Save the file under “Documents” -&amp;gt; “PH_Recordings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send the file to erinbrenner@uchicago.edu:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open Chrome or Safari (using the same method you used to open Microwave or from the dock below)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording -&amp;gt; enter Erin’s email address -&amp;gt; enter your email address -&amp;gt; press Send&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Naming Convention:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Genie Use and Safety</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/04/14/genie-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/04/14/genie-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-safety-tips&quot;&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-use-the-genie&quot;&gt;To use the genie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-put-the-genie-away&quot;&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introducing Lanyon</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2014/01/02/introducing-lanyon/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2014/01/02/introducing-lanyon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is an unassuming &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It’s based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt;, the Jekyll butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-on-poole&quot;&gt;Built on Poole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt;. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, &lt;a href=&quot;/404&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, posts, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly design and development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily scalable text and component sizing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; units in the CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lanyon-features&quot;&gt;Lanyon features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via &lt;strong&gt;☰&lt;/strong&gt; link in top corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; (right sidebar), available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes&quot;&gt;Eight optional color schemes&lt;/a&gt;, available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme&quot;&gt;Head to the readme&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;browser-support&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Example content</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2014/01/01/example-content/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-01T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2014/01/01/example-content</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;dis parturient montes&lt;/a&gt;, nascetur ridiculus mus. &lt;em&gt;Aenean eu leo quam.&lt;/em&gt; Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etiam porta &lt;strong&gt;sem malesuada magna&lt;/strong&gt; mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inline-html-elements&quot;&gt;Inline HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To bold text&lt;/strong&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Mark otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown&quot;&gt;the project’s readme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;visiting the project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
