   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;lighting-basics&quot;&gt;Lighting Basics&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To work a lighting call, you should have a basic set of tools: a crescent-wrench, a flashlight, and a pair of gloves. The Performance Hall has extras of all of these, but it is worth investing in your own to guarantee that there are enough tools for everyone and that yours fit you well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always remember to note any changes you make and to put those notes in a place where others can see (eg: on the lighting board or on the scene control). Follow the plot as best as you can. If the architecture of the hall or work lights get in your way, talk to your supervisor and the lighting designer to come up with a compromise. Keep track of the dimmers you plug each unit into so the Patch on the board can be updated. Confirm that it is okay to modify the rep plot if any changes are being made to it, and make sure the rep plot is restored after the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are four permanent hanging positions in the Performance Hall: Catwalk 1, Catwalk 2, U5, and U7. If a designer requests lights in another location, consult your supervisor before moving on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-definitions&quot;&gt;Basic Definitions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Unit:&lt;/u&gt; refers to the entire lighting instrument.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Yoke:&lt;/u&gt; the squared piece of metal, open on one side, which connects the unit to its mounting hardware.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Tee-handle:&lt;/u&gt; Located on the side of the yolk, the tee-handle controls the tilt of the light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Lamp:&lt;/u&gt; In theater lighting, light bulbs are called lamps. The units in the Performance Hall can take either 575 or 750 watt lamps. We currently only stock 575w. Lamps of all kinds are kept in the backstage cabinet. NEVER touch the glass on a new theatrical lamp with your bare skin. The oil from your fingers will cause the lamp to explode when it heats up. Use gloves, the foam it was packaged in, or the corner of your shirt to cover the lamp while you work with it. Always turn off and unplug (excluding the orchestra lights, which are hardwired) a unit before your change a lamp. Place dead lamps in the assigned box in the cabinet backstage and recycle the boxes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gel:&lt;/u&gt; Called gels because they were originally made of gelatin, modern gels are made of acetate (same material as transparencies). Gels are used to change the color of the light or fuzz the hard edges of a beam (called frost or diffusion gels). They come in a variety of colors. The Performance Hall stocks primarily gel made by Rosco (identified with an R before the number). We also might have a few miscellaneous sheets of Lee, Apollo, and GAM gels, identified with L, A, or G before the number). If possible, always use Rosco colors for consistency. When cutting gel, always label cuts and extra pieces with the appropriate letter and number using the China marker on the gel table. Always cut to the inside of the tape lines on the gel cutter. Do not use this cutter for anything but gel. The numbers on gels are assigned according to their place in the color spectrum. Remember that Rosco gels with numbers in the 300s, such as R343, were added in after the official spectrum was set out and are slightly modified versions of existing colors. Therefore, R343 comes between R43 and R44, and is a modified version of R43. Darker gels tend to burn through faster as they block more of the light spectrum from transmission, converting more energy into heat, though you can combat this with heat shield(R1991 or L269), installed before the gel.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gel Frame:&lt;/u&gt; Gel frames are used to hold cuts of gel in place in front of a unit. They come in a variety of sizes, 6 ¼” (for Leko’s), 7 ½” (for pars), and 12” (for 10 degree Lekos). Open the gel clip on the front of the unit by sliding it to the side to unlock and then flipping it up. Then, drop the gel frame into the slot closer to the unit (to minimize light leak) and make sure it is secure on all 4 sides. If using heat shield, it should be on the inside of the gel.  When hung correctly, the gel clip should sit on the top of the unit. Make sure the gel clip is down once the gel frame is in and everything is secure.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Safety:&lt;/u&gt; A safety is a specialized piece of aircraft cable with a carabiner on one end and a loop on the other. A safety is used to ensure that if any piece of hardware on the unit should fail, the unit will not fall from the pipe and hurt anyone/anything below. Always remember to secure the safety on the unit to the pipe. Additionally, secure the safety underneath any cable running on the pipe. Should the safety be necessary, you do not want it to cut through any live cable and electrify the unit and pipe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Tail:&lt;/u&gt; refers to the male plug coming out of the unit. When hung correctly, the tail should come out of the bottom of the unit. Never tie up the tail, always tie the extension to the pipe instead. Give yourself enough room for focus when running cable to a light. Tie the circuit as close to the unit as possible. When done focusing, tuck the tail into the yoke of the unit to make your work as clean as possible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Conventional Light:&lt;/u&gt; Any light where everything is manually controlled except for the brightness of the incandescent lamp, which is plugged into a dimmer circuit. Used to differentiate them from Intelligent/LED/moving lights. All stage lights in the performance hall currently are Conventional lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Practical:&lt;/u&gt; This is a standard light (not a stage light) that might be needed on stage, like a desk lamp. To control it from the board, you will need to use a stage-pin to female edison adapter to connect to the light to a dimmer.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Electric:&lt;/u&gt; A flown batten over the stage on which stage lights are hung (a hanging position). Usually, lighting circuits are attached to it or nearby for convenience. In the performance hall, our permanent electrics are U5 and U7.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dead-hung:&lt;/u&gt; when the light is hung with the yolk directly under the pipe.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Yolked out:&lt;/u&gt; when the light is hung with the yolk out away from the pipe, often at a 90° angle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;RFU:&lt;/u&gt;  Remote Focus Unit. This is essentially a remote for the lighting board and allows you to access many of its functions without taking the whole light board with you. You should take it with you if you are focusing lights, as it will make your life vastly easier.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;DMX:&lt;/u&gt; DMX or, Digital MultipleX, is a protocol used to control lighting instruments that do more than just dim so we can have digital control over all their attributes from the lighting board. DMX cable is 5-pin XLR and various lengths are stored in the shelving next to the metal cabinet backstage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Ethercon:&lt;/u&gt; Ethercon is Ethernet cable in a fancier housing. It is gradually replacing DMX as the lighting communication protocol. In the hall, we have lighting ethernet ports around the theater (labeled Lighting Network). To convert Ethercon to DMX, you will need a DMX node (stored in the shelving next to the metal cabinet). This plugs into the lighting network via ethercon and will output DMX to lights that require it. If it is not working, ask your shift leader for help configuring these nodes as they are quite complex.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Bench focus:&lt;/u&gt; The beam of the unit will naturally tend to have a hot-spot, where the light is the brightest in the center of the beam. To reduce the difference between the brightness hot-spot of the beam (center) and the brightness of the outer edges of the beam, you must bench focus the unit. If it is benched all the way to peak, the center will be much brighter, while if it is benched all the way to flat, the center will be darker than the rest of the circle. Peak benching is better when one is blending multiple units together to evenly wash the stage (as it reduces the brightness of overlap between fixtures), while flat is better the rest of the time. Inside a unit, the lamp sits inside a spherical reflector. Essentially, bench focusing adjusts the vertical lamps placement within the reflector, changing the beam of light. To bench focus a Strand LekoLite, twist the black knob on the back of the unit, testing each direction. To bench focus an ETC source 4, also twist the black knob on the back of the unit, not the gold one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dimmer:&lt;/u&gt; The physical power module that dims the circuit that the fixture is plugged into. Older dimmers used resistance to dim, but those were bulky and inefficient, so modern dimmers dim by chopping the sine wave of the electricity. They only work with incandescent sources, and so you should never plug in non-incandescent devices into theatrical dimmers. Our dimmers are rated for 20 Amps/2.4 KW&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Non-dim/relay:&lt;/u&gt; A circuit that provides constant, switchable power that does not dim, used for power to devices with more capabilities than conventional lights and separate digital control signal (Intelligent/LED/moving lights)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Circuit:&lt;/u&gt; Where you plug the light into on the wall. If hard-patched 1:1, the circuit number corresponds to the dimmer number that the board can control to turn the light on and off.  The hall is no longer patched 1:1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Channel:&lt;/u&gt; An arbitrary number that you can soft-patch to any address/dimmer for your convenience on the lighting board, i.e. It would be easiest for you to have your frontlight in channels 1-10 rather than having to remember each individual dimmer number every unit is plugged into.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Submaster:&lt;/u&gt; A number of channels at different levels that you can control together as a group on a fader. We have recorded our most often used groups of lights on Sub Page 1 for easy access. If you need to program a special group of lights for a show, program them into another Sub Page (2 or 3 most likely).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cue:&lt;/u&gt; A snapshot of the state of all lighting in the space; the building blocks of a cue list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cuelist/Cue Stack:&lt;/u&gt; A programmed list of all the different lighting looks for a show and the times to get from one to the next. You advance to the next cue in a cuelist by hitting the “go” button on the light board and to go backwards by hitting the “halt/back” button.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Live:&lt;/u&gt; If you are in ‘live’ mode on the light board, anything you program will appear immediately on stage and in the house.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Blind:&lt;/u&gt; A screen on the light board that allows you to program without modifying the live light levels in the house and on stage; a good way to make many needed changes without going dark on the performers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;kinds-of-lights&quot;&gt;Kinds of Lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;ERS (Ellipsoidal Reflector Spot):&lt;/u&gt; Also called Lekos or Profiles, these are the most flexible type of conventional (incandescent) light. The Performance Hall has two brands of ERS units: those made by E.T.C. (called a Source 4) and by Strand (called a Leko Lite). In general, the units are pretty much the same, though they differ in lamps (and how to change one), placement of barrel knobs (and extra bits), amount of heat given off (beware, Leko Lites get much hotter than Source 4s and will burn through gels with less output to the unit) and weight, but otherwise the units are pretty much the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Barrel:&lt;/u&gt; Also known as Lens Tubes, barrels sit on the front of the units. They contain lenses, sitting at various distances from one another in order to create a specific beam size. Barrels come in a variety of “degrees”: 10°, 19°, 26°, 36°, and 50°.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The smaller the degree of the lens, the smaller the beam spread.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Barrels are interchangeable between units made by the same manufacturer (Leko Lite barrels work in all Leko Lites, Source 4 barrels in all Source 4s).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For both kinds of units, the barrel knobs are located on the bottom of the unit. If barrels are taken out of bodies (the entire unit minus the barrel), keep the barrel knobs with the barrel! Be wary, the Strand barrel knobs have tiny bits of extra hardware. Try not to lose these.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Be extremely careful when changing barrels on lights that are hung and make sure no one is under you (announce your presence so that everyone in the house can hear you).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To focus a unit’s beam, loosen the barrel knob just a bit while holding onto the front of the barrel to prevent if from falling and slide the barrel up and down in the body to the desired beam sharpness.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Shutter:&lt;/u&gt; Shutters are used to create straight cuts on an otherwise circular beam. There are four shutters in total, located halfway down the body of a unit. Shutters affect the beam opposite to what you would expect, i.e.: push in a top shutter, get a bottom cut, push in a stage right shutter, get a stage left cut, etc. If you cannot make a cut at a necessary  angle, rotate the barrel.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To rotate the barrel on an ETC source 4, loosen the knob on the bottom of the unit by the bottom shutter (not the barrel knob) enough to spin the body. Tighten the knob again and make your cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To rotate the barrel on a Strand Lekolite, loosen the flat knob on the right side of the unit near the Tee-Handle enough to spin the body. Tighten the knob again and make your cuts.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Replacing Lamps:&lt;/u&gt; Burnt lamps should have visibly damaged filaments and be placed in the dead lamp bin found on top of the lighting storage shelving unit.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in an ETC unit (either source 4 or PAR) you will need an HPL 575w:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the golden screw on the back on the unit and remove the cap.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unlatch the pins (in source 4 only) and pull the old lamp out.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Put in the new lamp and relatch the pins.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Replace the cap by aligning the ridges on the back of the unit and tighten the golden screw.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a Strand unit, you will need a NPA Phillips FastFit 575w:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Flip open the back of the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the lamp with the help of pliers, and take it out.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Place the new lamp in the back of the unit and screw it into place.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Flip the cover back into place.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Leko Lites and Source 4s all take 6 1/4” gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Fresnel:&lt;/u&gt; (named after the inventor of the special lens made up of concentric circles in the fixture) - Note: The performance hall does not stock these, but we do rent/use them occasionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Uses a fixed lens&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lamp housing and reflector move back and forth within the housing to go from a wide beam spread (lamp moved towards the lens) to a narrow beam spread (lamp slides away from the lens). There will be a knob or crank that allows you to slide the lamp and reflector back and forth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soft, circular, wash beam (sharp focus impossible), but good for blending&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Slot in the front for gel frames/accessories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;PAR&lt;/u&gt; (Parabolic Anbolized Reflector): These produce a soft, elliptical beam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lens: We have S4 PARs, which have interchangeable lenses to achieve different beam spreads:
Very Narrow Spot (VNSP): Clear glass. Creates a 15° beam shape.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Narrow Spot (NSP): Slightly foggy, stippled glass. Creates a 19° beam shape.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Medium Flood (MFL): Checkered with seven lines. Medium lenses create a 21°x34° oblong beam.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wide Flood (WFL): Checkered with more than seven lines. Wide lenses create a 30°x51° oblong beam shape.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just like with shutters, the lenses in S4 PARs work in opposites. If the lens’ lines run upstage-downstage, your beam will run stage left-stage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change the shape of the beam, you may rotate the lens (lamp assembly in other PARs), rotating the oblong shape. Just behind the gel frame, you will feel ridges, and if you push against the ridges, the lens will spin.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;S4 PARs take 7 ½” gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;CYC Light&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The performance hall does not own any cyc lights, but we frequently rent them. They are open-faced/flood lights (usually seated on the floor because of no space on the electrics) that serve to solidly light the white scrim/cyc (frequently hung on DLight) in any color via oversized gels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They are large and cumbersome, and have enormous gel frames (size depending on the manufacturers and models).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They have asymmetric reflectors which means that vertically in one direction the light will spread infinitely while in the other there is a defined cutoff to the beam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the lights are mounted on the floor, the defined cutoff should be focused to the bottom of the cyc. If hung, focused to the top of the cyc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The only focus adjustment on these lights is pan and tilt&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Intelligent/LED Lights:&lt;/u&gt; Occasionally there will be events in the hall that rent intelligent lights (ones with motorized pan and tilt are often referred to as Movers) that are more capable than conventional lights as they have multiple attributes (like pan and tilt, or color, or zoom) that can be controlled remotely from the lighting board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;These will often be quite a bit heavier than lights you are used to and have different clamping mechanisms so it is often advisable to hang these with another person to help.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They cannot be plugged into the stage pin dimmers. They must, must be connected to non-dimmed power, and the 20Amp non-dim relays that are located on all the lighting positions are the best choice for them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They will also need DMX cable run to them and daisy chained between them. So that the board and identify them and control them, a different DMX address will need to be set on each of them, between 1-512, and then told to the lighting designer in the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you do not know what to do with such lights, ask for help!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Follow-spot:&lt;/u&gt; The Performance Hall has two followspots, both Lycian SuperArc 400. Followspots are used in shows where a performer moves around the stage and needs to be seen while moving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A good followspot operator can predict where the beam of the followspot will land before the light is turned on. Additionally, a followspot operator should be as steady as possible. Never jump with the followspot, as it looks ugly to the audience. If you miss your spot, move slowly and with purpose to pick up your cue. This requires practice. Before running followspot for a show, give yourself some time to warm up and get used to the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Followspots have the capability to change color, depending on what gels are dropping in the five slots.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Iris changes the size of the beam, the dowser dims it, and the shutter/horizontal dowser dowses the beam horizontally&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To use to the followspot:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure it is plugged into the wall.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the switch on the back right side of the unit to turn it on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Stand (or sit on a tall stool) on the right side of the followspot. You will control the unit from the right at all times, holding the two handles labelled “control” to move the light.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Familiarize yourself with the various settings on the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Check the focus of your beam. Confirm with the lighting designer how sharp the edge should be.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gels in followspots do not fit a square gel frame. They are circular. Use an old gel cut from a followspot as reference when cutting new color. To change color in the followspot:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the followspot off and let it cool down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push all the gel frames into the up position.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the two screws by the gel changing levers.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Remove the entire section.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull the old color.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the old color with the new, securing it with brads or paperclips.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the entire section back in the followspot.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Tighten the screws again.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Release the gel frames.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Test each color lever and reseat the color section if necessary.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;House Lights:&lt;/u&gt; The house lights in the Performance Hall are located in the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th catwalks. Before each show, check that all the house lights are on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a house light you will need a PAR 38 lamp:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the switch on the handle to cut off the power running to the house light.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the wingnuts holding the base in the fixture. Put them in your pocket or somewhere safe where they won’t fall through the grating of the catwalk.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Grab the handle and lift the base out of the fixture.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the old lamp.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Screw in the new lamp. You can touch these lamps with your bare hands.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Place the base back in the fixture.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Replace the wingnuts.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Flip the house light switch back on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Catwalk Work Lights:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To change a lamp in a catwalk work light, you will need a Biax T/E Eco 32w Lamp:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carefully balance yourself on the railings. If you do not have a buddy, you will need to climb down and back up while carrying things in order to finish this process.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the outer cage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unscrew the glass cover.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull out the old lamp.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not worry about touching these new lamps with your bare hands. Push in the new lamp and replace the covers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Music Stand Lights:&lt;/u&gt; Music stand lights are used when musicians are on stage, playing in the dark. They are stored in a bin in the new storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clip the music stand light onto the music stand and plug it into an Edison power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change lamps by unscrewing the old and screwing in a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To store a music stand light, coil the cable and place it over the lamp. Then, fold the clip up over the cable. By keeping the cable inside the body of the light, it will not become tangled with other lights in the bin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mounting&quot;&gt;Mounting&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Units can be mounted on four kinds of hardware. As with all hardware you encounter, keep all the bits and pieces together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;C-clamp:&lt;/u&gt; These are what you will find most units in the Performance Hall mounted on. Like their names, they are shaped like C’s. When hanging a unit on a C-clamp, hang it so the open side faces you. Then, tighten the bolt with a wrench.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Tee:&lt;/u&gt; Used in tandem with sidearms. The bolt connects to the yoke of the unit, in place of the C-Clamp Remember to tighten both bolts on the tee.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Floor plate:&lt;/u&gt; These are used for placing units on the floors. They are square pieces of wood with a hole in the center, with a bolt, a nut, and washers. Always keep the hardware with the floor plate so the next stagehand does not need to go searching for it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Booms:&lt;/u&gt; 50 lb boom bases are located in the Southwest corner of backstage. Find the marked 10’, 1 ½” diameter boom pipes in the storage room across from the green room. Screw pipes tightly into bases, and then hang units either yoked out or on a side arm on either the up or downstage side of the pipe. Then, point them onstage. Be consistent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;accessories&quot;&gt;Accessories&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most common accessories sit in the outer frame of a unit. Always tie the safety length of tie line connected to the accessory to the yoke of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Top Hats:&lt;/u&gt;  Top hats are used to counter light spill. Named because they look like top hats, they can be used in source 4 or PAR units. We have Top Hats for S4 Pars.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Half Hats or Tipton Hats:&lt;/u&gt; Like top hats, only cut in half lengthwise, so they only block half of the light beam.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Barn Doors:&lt;/u&gt; Like top hats, only square-shaped, and, like shutters, you can move each section to cut off light from places you don’t want. Used in PARs and Fresnels.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Gobos:&lt;/u&gt; A gobo, also known as a template, is used to make a pattern on the stage. Gobos come in either metal (most commonly sizes A or B) or glass. The Performance Hall only has template holders for metal, size B. Gobos are only used in ERS units, but we only have holders for them for the Strand Leko Lites. Gobos are installed at the gate of the unit, where the lens and the reflector meet perfectly, where a perfectly in focus pattern is possible. Before placing a gobo in a unit, put it in a template holder. These can be found by the gels in Catwalk 4. To install a gobo on a Strand Lekolite, unscrew the gate cover, slide it open, and slide the template holder in. Close the gate as much as you can, and tighten the screws. To install a gobo on an ETC Source 4, slide the holder in just forward of the top shutter. Be careful, though, gobos get extremely hot very quickly, so be careful when removing them after the light has been on for some time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Irises:&lt;/u&gt; An iris in a lights acts just like an iris in an eye. Used to make beams even smaller, irises sit in the accessory slot forward of the gobo slot. To access this slot on an ETC Source 4, you will need to use a screwdriver to slide down the accessory slot cover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;troubleshooting-equipment&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Sniffer:&lt;/u&gt; These check for current in a wire or outlet&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;GAM Check:&lt;/u&gt; It is a standardized troubleshooting device for stage pin connections. It has two settings, CABLE and [lamp], which represents a lamp. When the switch is flipped to the lamp setting, plug a unit into the female end of the GAM check. The GAM check will beep if the lamp is good. If it does not beep, change the lamp in the unit. To check if a unit is receiving power, flip to the CABLE setting and plug the male end of the GAM check into the female dimmer you are using. Turn the dimmer on at the board. If the dimmer is working, you will get three green LEDS on the GAM check. If you get another combination of lights, refer to the key on the GAM check itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;types-of-cable&quot;&gt;Types of Cable&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The cable in the Performance Hall is labeled with electrical tape according to length. All lighting power cable is rated for at least 20 Amps and is SOOW (Extra hard usage, oil resistant, water resistant).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Beige = 5’	Red = 10&#39;	Green = 25’	Blue = 50’	White =100’
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With any piece of cable, there is a male and female end. They mean just what you would think: the male end is the one with pins sticking out, the female the end with holes. The male end will never be the live end (only female ends will be live so you can’t get electrocuted). Remember that, sadly, there is no homosexuality in electricity. The male always goes toward your power source (male is the input end, female the output). Be consistent when running cable by running it on one side of the pipe. Cable should be regularly tied off to pipe (using tie line) to prevent any slack from dangling. Excess cable should be neatly coiled and then tie lined to the pipe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Edison cable&lt;/u&gt; is the technical term for the standard A/C cable used in the United States, named for the almighty Thomas Edison (nah, Tesla was cooler). Therefore, the regular extension cords you are used to (if you grew up in the U.S.) are Edison.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Stage Pin&lt;/u&gt; is used with theatrical lighting and is at least rated up to 20 Amps. Stage pin has three pins just like Edison cable, but is shaped like a flat square.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twistlock&lt;/u&gt; Similar pin layout to Edison, but the pins are curved. Twistlock cables are inserted, and then the connection is twisted until it locks (as you might expect from the name). The non-dim relay circuits (labeled with an S-) use twistlock&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Twofer&lt;/u&gt; is used to plug two lights into the same circuit. They look like a Y, with one male end and two female ends. Be careful to not overload the lighting circuit with too many lights (no more than four per circuit, preferably three).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Adapters:&lt;/u&gt; The Performance Hall has a few kinds of adapters, Edison ➝ Stage Pin, Stage Pin ➝  Edison, and Twistlock ➝ Edison. If the male end is Edison, the unit plugged in will be non-dimmable. If the male end is Stage Pin, it will be able to dim. The Twistlock ➝ Edison adapters are used for connecting to the non-dim/relay circuits and running power towards intelligent/moving fixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;u&gt;Multicable&lt;/u&gt;, or &lt;u&gt;Socopex&lt;/u&gt;, is essentially six stage pin circuits in one. The Performance Hall only has female soco above stage, over U5 and U7. To change from mult to stage pin, or from stage pin to mult, you will need one of the following.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-out: A male mult end with six female stage pins.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-in: A female mult end with six male stage pins.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Break-outs and break-ins can either be straight or staggered.
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Straight: All the stage pins lengths are the same.&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;Staggered: The stage pin lengths vary with 1 being the shortest and 6 being the longest.&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When circuiting a pipe with a break-out, the six circuit numbers align one-to-one with the circuits you plugged the mult into. For example, if you plug the break-out into circuits 119-124, the stage pin labelled 1 will be dimmer 119, 2 will be 120, and so on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;things-to-remember-when-hanging-and-focusing-lights&quot;&gt;Things to remember when hanging and focusing lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lights should (if possible) be spaced with at least 1’6” between each clamp so as to allow space for it to rotate and point differently during focus. The distance between your elbow and fingertips is approximately 1’6”, and so you can use your arm to measure as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lock everything down with your wrench. Only tighten bolts a quarter or half turn past finger tight, otherwise you begin to bend the bolt, weakening it, and making it more likely to break and fall.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the safety cable is looped over the pipe and attached back to itself.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to pull all shutters. Otherwise, you will think the unit does not work even when turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tie a clove hitch when tying up cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never tie up the tail of the cable coming from the light.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tie the female end of the circuit you are plugging into close to the unit, so you always have enough slack in the cable for the light to pointed in all manner of different directions (called a focus loop).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are running a long cable, label the female end of the cable with the circuit number it is plugged into using white gaff and a sharpy (stored on Catwalk 4). It will make you life vastly easier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Any cable running in traveled walkways must be taped down in a clean manner and marked in white spike tape to ensure that people don’t trip. When needed, use a cable mat to cover the cable, and mark it in diagonal stripes of white spike tape.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use gloves when focusing will prevent burns (especially with the Strand Leko Lites).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;… And when striking lights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Push in all shutters.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run barrels in completely.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrap the tail around the unit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hang units in their appropriate storage space in the catwalks, tightening the bolt with only your fingers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;light-board-operation&quot;&gt;Light Board Operation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like most modern light boards, the &lt;em&gt;Strand Light Palette Classic&lt;/em&gt; is composed of two main sections—the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; sections. The &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; section allows you to set up and program different lighting looks and adjust settings on the board, while the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; section allows you to recall those different looks in different manners. On the &lt;em&gt;Strand Light Palette Classic&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;u&gt;Playback&lt;/u&gt; section is mostly on your left, consisting of the twelve sliders (called submasters/looks) and associated buttons and the two groups of two sliders above  “Go” buttons (labeled AB and CD). The number and key pads, retractable keyboard and mouse on the right make up the &lt;u&gt;Programming&lt;/u&gt; section. Outlined below are some basic operations of the board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On/Off&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To turn the board on, hit the power switch underneath the lip of the board, towards your left. To turn the board off, go to the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu, at the top left corner of the screen, click on &lt;strong&gt;Exit&lt;/strong&gt;, and then, after assuring it that you do want to exit and saving your show, click on the onscreen power button once the main interface has closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Saving/Opening Shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have made significant changes to the show, you’ll want to save your show as something new. Click on &lt;strong&gt;Save As&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu and enter the show name that you want. Save frequently by just clicking &lt;strong&gt;Save&lt;/strong&gt; to save the show with the same name. To open a show that you have worked on, click on &lt;strong&gt;Open&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;strong&gt;File&lt;/strong&gt; menu and select the desired show file (don’t open the archive folders).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Softkeys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may notice that there is a line of keys numbered S1-S12. These are called softkeys and their functions change depending on what you are doing. Their functions are displayed in boxes along the bottom of the screen labeled S1-S12 so you know what they’ll do before you hit them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patching&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To assign fixtures to different channel numbers than their dimmer/address for convenience (i.e. you might your front light to be in Channels 1-10 to make it easy to remember rather than having to remember the dimmers that they are plugged into), hit the button labeled “Patch.” This will take you to the patch screen and you’ll see a list of “fixtures” and “outputs.” “Fixtures” are what this board calls channels and “outputs” are dimmers/addresses. To assign a dimmer to a different channel, type in, on the keypad, first the number that you want that dimmer to be assigned to, followed by [@] then the number of the dimmer you are assigning, followed by [Enter]. For example, if I wanted dimmer #39 to be in channel #4, I would type in: 4 [@] 39 [Enter] The command line on the screen should read: “Patch Fixture 4 to Output 39.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To change the order of the syntax (fixture or output first), hit S11 (it should say on the screen “Patch by Output in the S11 box), and you can then enter the output first and then dimmer. With the same goal as the previous example, the syntax would then be: 39 [@] 4 [Enter], on the keypad and “Patch Output 39 to fixture 4” on the command line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be careful when switching between syntaxes as you can easily make mistakes by thinking you are in one syntax when the board is set for the other. Always watch the command line to verify what you are typing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Selecting, Turning on, and Releasing a Channel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To turn on a channel and bring the light(s) associated with it up, type in the channel number on the keypad, then hit [@] and then enter the level (between 0-100% brightness) that you wish the channel to be at, then hit [Enter]. For example, if you wanted to turn on Channel 7 at 73%, you would type in: 7 [@] 73 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The channel that you put at 73% will be highlighted with a solid red box, showing that it is currently the selected channel. While it is selected, you can modify the level using the wheel at the right end of the light board, by using the [Up] or [Down] keys, by saying [@] and then another level, or by hitting the convenient [Full] or [Out] keys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To release the channel from selection and turn it off (unless it was recorded into something), hit the [Undo] button. Hitting it multiple times will release channels that you had set to levels previously, restoring all the channels to their prior state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To select/turn on multiple channels, you can use the [Thru], [+], and [-] keys on the number pad, and you will have control over all of them. For example, if you wanted to turn on Channels 1-15, and 33, except for 11 all at Full, you would type in: 1 [Thru] 15 [+] 33 [-] 11 [@] [Full].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You get the idea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording a Submaster/Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A Submaster (called a “look” on this board) is a group of channels that you can bring up to set levels together for convenience. An infinite number of looks can be recorded to different submaster “pages” (you can move between pages in the upper left hand corner of the screen). Looks number 1-12 in each page correspond to the twelve sliders on the left hand side of the board as well as the bottom row of “bump buttons” below the sliders. The bump buttons allow you to flash the look while you are holding it down and kill the look when you release it. Looks 13-24 you can access via the Bump Buttons buttons above the sliders, and 25-48 are in the two rows directly below the sliders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To record a look, set channels at their desired levels and then hit [Rec] and [Look] followed by the look’s number you want to record to and then [Enter]. You have to hit [Enter] twice to confirm that you want to overwrite an already recorded look. For example, if you wanted to record look 17, you would type in: [Rec] [Look] 17 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may also record a look by hitting [Rec] [Look] and then hitting the bump button of the look you want, though this will only work for looks 1-48.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may recall a look by hitting [Look] followed by the number of the Look you want and the level of its channels, then [Enter]. Those channels are now selected and you may modify them using the wheel or [Up] or [Down] keys. For example, if you wanted to recall Look 17 to 40%, you would type: [Look] 17 [@] 40 [Enter]. You may also recall looks using the submasters/bump buttons themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recording/Modifying a Cue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A cue is similar to a submaster in that it is a snapshot of lighting levels. Strung together, though, with timings, they are much more powerful. Cues work in an ordered list called a “Cuelist” or “Cue Stack” that follows the course of the production. To advance from one cue to the next, as the production progresses, hit the “Go button” at the appropriate moments underneath the playback sliders (AB).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Record a Cue, set the lighting to the levels that you want, then hit [Rec] followed by the number of the Cue, then [Enter]. The number of the cue will determine the order in which it is played back, as the cuelist progresses from low to high. You may assign cues with numbers such as 14.3 if you need to insert a cue between two other cues, though it is often wise to start out leaving gaps in your numbering (numbering by 5s for example) to leave space for future cue insertions as decimal point cues can be cumbersome. For example, to record cue 10, you would type in: [Rec] 10 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To assign a time other than the default time of three (the time it takes to crossfade from one cue to the next), hit [Cue] followed by the number of the cue, then [Time] and then the cue’s crossfade time. By hitting time twice and assigning times each time, you may assign separate up fade (lights coming in) and down fade (lights going out) times for a cue for more precise control over the crossfading. For example, if you wanted the lights in Cue 7 to go out faster than the lights in Cue 8 to come on, you would type, for example: [Cue] 8 [Time] 5 [Time] 3 [Enter]. That would create a cue with an uptime of 5 seconds and a downtime of 3 seconds. You can also give the cue a time when you are recording it. For example, you could type:
[Rec] 8 [Time] 6 [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may assign a follow time to a cue as well, so that it will automatically execute the next cue after the follow time. For example: [Cue] 8 [Follow] 200.89. Cue 8 will now automatically advance into Cue 9 after 200.89 seconds. Be careful, the follow time starts counting down immediately when the cue starts, not after the fade time is executed, so if your follow time is less than your fade time, the next cue will start executing before the earlier one is finished fading in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To update a cue, you may go to a cue, change the lighting levels as necessary, and then hit [Update].
To Delete a cue, you may hit the [Delete] button, followed by the Cue number, and then hit [Enter].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Playing Back Cues&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To Go to a given cue, you may hit the [Goto] button followed by the cue number. You will then be in that cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To Go to the next cue, in the time assigned to it, hit the [Go] button below the AB Playback Sliders. You may use the [Halt/Back] button if you need to stop a cue from fading in or go back to a past cue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Congratulations! You have finished the Lighting Basics Section!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>performancehall.github.io/employees/tech-manual</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;#Production Assistant Tech Manual&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-to-be-a-great-stagehand-tips-and-tricks&quot;&gt;1. How to Be a Great Stagehand: Tips and Tricks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always arrive 10 minutes early for your call. If your call starts at 9am, that means you start working at 9am. Give yourself enough time to clock on, tool up, and get ready for work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember to stay busy during your work call. If you have nothing to do, ask your other crew members and supervisor if they need help doing anything. If no one needs help, keep yourself busy by working on something else like tidying backstage or the storage closets, sweeping or mopping the stage, returning tools to their homes, or organizing gels in the catwalks. If you’ve finished cleaning and your co-workers/supervisor still don’t need assistance, either ask for a break or spend the time getting more familiar with systems that you might not yet understand. If someone walks into the space while you are staring at your phone, book or computer, it reflects badly on the entire crew and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Appropriate Dress:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Close-toed shoes&lt;br /&gt;
Clothes you can move comfortably in&lt;br /&gt;
Full length pants&lt;br /&gt;
Appropriate tools for the job (flashlight, crescent wrench, etc)&lt;br /&gt;
Long hair is tied back&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do not wear:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Open-toed shoes&lt;br /&gt;
High heels&lt;br /&gt;
Dangly jewelry&lt;br /&gt;
Skirts or dresses&lt;br /&gt;
Torn or dirty clothes (unless it’s a tech day)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re working a show call and/or will be positioned backstage, wear all black (or as close as you can possibly get) with black/dark soft-soled shoes. NO shorts are allowed. If you’re working at front of house, wear all black OR dark professional clothes: button down shirt, dress pants, nice shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communicating:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t know how to do something, ask. It’s way better to spend more time on something during setup than to do something incorrectly if you’re unsure; we will all pay for it at showtime. Double/triple check everything you do and point out concerns or inconsistencies to the other crew members and supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do not be afraid to talk to those renting/using the spaces. Consider the implications of user requests before saying yes or no. If these requests are outside of your domain, bring that question to the right person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get access to the greenroom? Yes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we hang a curtain here? I’ll have to ask my Stage Manager or Supervisor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a 2nd wireless mic? I’ll ask the audio engineer for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a spotlight here? I’ll ask the lighting engineer for you.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can we get a table in the lobby for check in? Yes. Then, go grab a table from 065 and bring it up to the lobby. If you’re short on time, or can’t follow through, reach out to Operations for support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I peek through the stage door while people are in the house? No. Guide them to look at the video monitor at the Stage Manager Console instead (you have control over the camera, so you could scan the audience to get a feel for how crowded the house is). Otherwise, if they need a better view, tell them to sneak out into the lower vestibule and enter at the lower level entrance.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can I get a stage picture through the stage door? Tell them to hold while you ask the person in charge of the event to approve this request. Opening the stage door for any reason other than an entrance will distract the audience, but in the end it’s up to the person running the show.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lightheartedness and laughter are crucial and help us all get through long hours of hard labor, remember that you’re here to work. Try not to goof off too much while on the clock. Socialize after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing something that could potentially affect the entire crew, announce to everyone what you are doing. For example, if you are working in the catwalks or in a genie, shout, “Working overhead!” If you are bringing in a lineset, say, “Lineset moving!” or “U3 flying in!” Before you turn off all the lights off on stage or in the house, you should shout “Going dark!”. Always wait for acknowledgement from others in the space in the form of “Thank you!” before executing the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are patrons or members of the cast on stage or in the house and you need to be working up in the catwalks on lighting, check with your supervisor first. It may be better to wait until the space is empty. However, if time is tight, as it can often be, you may have to work despite others being in the way. Make sure those directly below you have cleared the area before continuing to work over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot make a shift for some reason, text/email other members of the crew to find a replacement. Let your manager know immediately. Your shift is your responsibility, so even if you have other things going on, get sick, injured or realize your have a paper due in the morning, you must find a cover because the show must go on. Be very careful when finding a cover because they must have the same skill set you do in order to do your job. Double check with this person the day before the shift to make sure they are still covering for you. If for some reason they fall through, it falls on you. Even one “incident” could put you into suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Physical hazards:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Be smart about lifting heavy objects! If you can’t lift it yourself, ask someone to help. If you are lifting something onto a cart, bring the cart close to the object you are moving. The less carrying, the less strain on your back. As always, lift with your knees, not your back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always confirm that lighting or audio equipment is off before plugging or unplugging anything. When using a blade, always cut away from yourself and others; be careful and use common sense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wear gloves and long sleeves when planning to touch hot lighting fixtures. Always wear shoes while on the deck. The stage floor splinters terribly and nobody wants that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Closing the Hall:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When closing the hall, don’t even ask if you can clock out or go home until every single thing is back in its place, stage/backstage/FOH are totally clean, everything is setup for the next event, all the systems are shut down and the three sets of exterior doors (as well as auxiliary doors to the storage closet, instrument storage, and green room) are closed and locked securely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Door stops:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Always push door stops into the vestibules, not out into the hallways! This is exactly how they grow legs and walk away. Also, push them to the sides of the vestibules so other people walking in don’t trip over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Piano safety:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Steinway is a big object on little wheels! Move it slowly and be aware of all hazards AT ALL TIMES. Do not allow it to come close to running into doors, door frames and walls or over items such as cables, curtain, or the little metal thresholds for the door closers. Immediately lock it down after moving it by twisting the pins on the two wheels near the piano keys clockwise until tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have locked down the piano, tri-fold the cover lengthwise, and then roll it up and store it backstage. Next, lift the cover off the piano keys. Then, slide the built in music stand toward the keys and lift it up into place. Ask the the pianist whether they would like the piano lid to be down, at half-stick, or at full-stick. Always double check that the wheels are locked before lifting the lid. The full stick sits in the square hole. The half stick sits in the circular hole. Be extremely careful when handling the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always have at least two people moving the piano; a third is helpful to open doors and move anything that’s in the way. These two people moving the piano, or at least one of them, should be from our team. If you see a group trying to move a piano on their own, please step in and put your hands on that piano until it is in place, the wheels are locked, and everyone has stepped away. Kindly open the lid for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remember to lock the stage wall panels. If they need to be open at an angle where they cannot lock, sandbag them. Sandbags can be found in the amp room. If you see bags sitting out, put them back in the amp room. Confirm that the panels are locked by pushing them gently once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, double and triple check your work, if necessary, to avoid messing up an entire show. Take your time, ask questions, do it right the first time and you won’t have to be embarrassed when it fails or waste everyone’s time while doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, spike the upstage offstage corners of objects. Spike the piano with L’s on the upstage and offstage sides of the legs. Spike music stands with T’s directly under the vertical of the stand. Have the long line of the T point the direction the stand faces. If you have more than one stage change, color code each setup. You can even write a note to yourself on the spike tape. Use sharpie or pen and keep it simple. If there is going to be a lot of movement/big set changes, it is a good idea to draw up a stage plot of each change and label the page with the appropriate color of spike tape. If marley is down, put a piece of clear tape over each spike to make sure it doesn’t get danced off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Direction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Stage right and left:&lt;/u&gt; When speaking stage direction, you always refer to it from the artist’s perspective.  If you are standing on stage, facing the audience, your left is stage left and right is stage right. If you are standing in the audience, or at FOH, and you are calling out stage movement, your left will become “stage right” and your right is “stage left”. Same rule applies to someone standing backstage left and looking onto stage from the wing; away from you should be referred to as “stage right”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;On and off stage:&lt;/u&gt; Sometimes, if you’re standing at a funny angle, up in the genie, or it doesn’t matter which direction you’re going, it may be easier for you to explain yourself using “on stage” and “off stage.”  “Off stage” is always referring to away from the center line and towards the wings in either direction. Moving something “on stage” would mean to move it toward the center line from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Flying in and out:&lt;/u&gt; This is how we refer to things that are moving up and down. Battens and banners fly in when they are moving down from the ceiling and they fly out when moving back up toward the ceiling. Always call out, in your loudest speaking voice, to the whole room when you are flying battens in or out. Example: Batten 2 flying out! Or lineset 6 flying in! The response should be: Thank you flying in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Terminology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Apron:&lt;/u&gt; The portion of the stage that is downstage of the proscenium arch. (Since we don’t have a built in proscenium in the hall, we consider the apron to be everything downstage of the ‘plaster line’.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Batten:&lt;/u&gt; Part of a fly system. A horizontal pipe, supported by lift lines, electrical hoists (ours are drum winch) &amp;amp; motors (variable speed), which is easily raised and lowered; even while holding a substantial amount of weight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Blackout:&lt;/u&gt; Removing all light from the stage, often for a set change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Boom:&lt;/u&gt; A boom is a vertical pipe standing anywhere onstage where lighting units are hung on stage, usually in the wings. They are usually screwed into 50lb boom bases.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Catwalks:&lt;/u&gt; A catwalk is a section of the house hidden in the ceiling from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Center Line:&lt;/u&gt; A special type of line drawn on a Ground Plan, located at the plane which bisects the stage left and stage right sides of the theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Crossover:&lt;/u&gt; The upstage place behind any stage curtains or scenery, which allows performers to get from one side of the stage to the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Cue:&lt;/u&gt; Any moment in the course of a performance where there is a change in the physical state. In the case of sound, a cue might start music playing, and then a subsequent cue might lower the volume as an actor starts to speak, and yet another might fade the music to silence when the scene comes to an end. Cues are most often associated with lighting and sound (any given show quite often has hundreds of light and sound cues), but cues are also established when scenery needs to change, line sets need to fly, effects need to be triggered, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Dimmer room:&lt;/u&gt; The room which contains the dimmer racks which power the lighting rig in the theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Electric:&lt;/u&gt; An electric is a horizontal pipe hanging upstage of the proscenium (usually part of the fly system), often with lighting circuits connected to it, where lighting units are hung in a theater.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Fly System:&lt;/u&gt; A series of pulleys, ropes, wires, and/or other apparatus which collectively allows the hanging and vertical movement of curtains, lighting instruments, scenery, and even people. (Our fly system is motorized electrical drum winch hoists and controlled through the automated rigging system.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Grand Curtain (or Main Curtain):&lt;/u&gt; The curtain that closes just upstage of the proscenium arch. Generally speaking, opening the grand curtain signifies the start of the show or act and closing it signifies the end of the act or show.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;House:&lt;/u&gt; The place where the audience sits to watch the performance. Also the place where lighting instruments hang when they’re hanging over the audience. Front-of-House can refer to the lobby or other non-performance space where audience members congregate before and after the show and during intermission. (Just to confuse things, Audio Engineers also refer to front-of-house, or FOH, as their house mix position in order to differentiate themselves from the the monitor engineer on stage.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Masking:&lt;/u&gt; As a noun, anything which hides something from the audience. As a verb, the act of hiding things from the audience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Plaster Line:&lt;/u&gt; An imaginary reference line on stage that indicates where the proscenium arch is. (Our plaster line runs stage left to right from about the point where the stage starts to curve on the downstage lip.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Proscenium Arch:&lt;/u&gt; The viewing portal or frame through which the audience sees the performance. (Our Proscenium Arch is theoretical except for when the grand curtain and border are hanging on U1 and U2.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Shell:&lt;/u&gt; A hard, often movable surface, designed to reflect sound into the audience for musical performances.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Sight lines:&lt;/u&gt; Imaginary lines indicating the view from the extreme-most seats. If someone or something is said to be in sight lines, it means that they are visible to all audience members regardless of seating choice. If someone or something is described as out of sightlines, it means that no audience members are able to see them. A good rule of thumb for sightlines is “if you can see them, they can see you.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Soft Goods:&lt;/u&gt; Curtains that are used onstage. This can include the “Blacks,” “Cyc,” “Grand Curtain,” and “Scrims,” among other things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Spike:&lt;/u&gt; Marking the stage floor with an indicator showing the location of a set piece or where a performer should stand. Spike marks are usually made on the upstage corners of a prop with small pieces of spike tape to show the direction it should be facing and also color coded by set transition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Stage/Deck:&lt;/u&gt; The primary playing space surrounded by the apron, wings, and fly space.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Strike:&lt;/u&gt; Strike can be referred to as temporarily taking something away (e.g. “During the scene change, you strike the phone.”).  It can also be used at the end of a run to specify that everything should be disassembled, put away and cleaned in order to have a fresh canvas for the next group coming in.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Trim:&lt;/u&gt; The height that a batten or any other object hangs at.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Wings:&lt;/u&gt; Areas that are part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are typically masked with legs. The wing space is used for performers preparing to enter, storage of sets for scenery changes and as a stagehand work area. Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the fly system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;marley-a-guide-to-laying-a-dance-floor&quot;&gt;2. Marley: A Guide to Laying a Dance Floor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Marley is a type of dance floor. It allows dancers to move easily across the deck and offers more give, resulting in higher and more efficient jumps. Marley comes in heavy vinyl strips. These strips are about four feet wide and span the length of the stage. To both lay out and strike marley, you need at least two people. Ideally, you have a crew of four: two to tape down a strip while the other two prep the next strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s marley is stored on pieces of white PVC pipe backstage right. When the flooring is down, the empty rolls can live backstage left, preferably upstage and out of the way. To lay the marley you’ll start offstage right. When rolling it back up you’ll start offstage left. The bottom of the marley will be on the outside of the roll; make sure the correct side is face up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before marley is laid out, the stage should be swept thoroughly. The Performance Hall’s marley is cut into seven panels (1 = upstage, 7 = downstage apron). Each is labeled. If for some reason you can’t find the label, relabel it using gaff tape and a sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay a marley floor you will need: marley tape, scissors/a blade, at least one buddy, knee pads (optional). While Marley tape is black like gaff tape, it is smooth and shiny in texture. Do not use gaff tape on the marley; it will leave behind a residue. When you need to cut marley tape, use scissors or a blade. Don’t try to tear the marley tape, it’s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both laying and striking the marley, the wings stage left and right should be open. The marley will lie underneath them. Be careful when sliding the marley under each panel; go too far and you’ll hit a hinge and need to readjust. Try not to cover any of the panel locking drop holes so you can still lock them into place if needed. Be aware that the Performance Hall’s stage is trapezoidal. The upstage wall is shorter than the downstage edge and the marley is cut to match this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laying Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Beginning the process:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, move the roll #6 of marley to the stage right, downstage corner. The rolls are very heavy, so be careful and work in a team when possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The best way to move the marley is to slowly walk the roll over on its end.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the marley onto the floor so the longer edge is downstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the pieces of tape holding the roll together. If any tape goo is left on the marley, clean it before laying it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the marley fully by pushing the roll across the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the PVC pipes in the backstage left corner, upstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;With another person, align the edges of the marley with off stage walls. Once it’s even on both sides and kissing the lip, park it and tape it down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are no bubbles, tape the stage left and right sides down first. Use three pieces of tape running off stage (one upstage, one downstage and one center) to anchor both sides.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are bubbles, tape one side down and have one person kneel on that edge to hold it in place. Have a second person on the other edge pulling toward themselves and a third person stomp across toward the second person. Once the third person has crossed the stage, the second person will tape their edge down before the third person steps off the marley.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Taping lengthwise:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start offstage right and work your way stage left as a team (or vice versa).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will hold the tape down while the Tech B creates a long stretch of slack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before touching the tape down, Tech B will stretch it taut and carefully hold it over the seam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tech A will then smoothly press the tape onto the ground (moving toward Tech B) and check for any irregularity along the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Continue this process across the length of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Techs A and B are taping Panel 6, Techs C and D should be prepping the next panel, laying the rest of the panels out in order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When securing section #7, tape slowly and try to follow the curve of the lip smoothly. If you must fold tape over the stage edge, do so, but do it neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have irregularity, fix the issue before moving on. Irregularity can create dangerous situations for dancers who are unaware of the problem. Here are some situations you would fix:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the marley is overlapping under the tape, either press it out or lift up and start again. A small gap between panels is better than overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is a bubble in the marley itself, stomp it out in the direction you’re taping.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your roll runs out of tape, cut that edge straight, tape it down and grab a new roll. Line up the new piece of tape carefully to ensure clean overlap.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just laid your own dance floor! Only one more thing to do before you take a break: dry sweep and mop the marley flooring. Use a bit of the Roscoe Marley Floor Cleaner in your bucket of water but nothing else. If an outside stage manager wants to use something else, ask your supervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every rehearsal or performance on marley, the stage must be swept and then mopped. Mop in smooth figure eights across the stage pulling the dirt toward you and not pushing it out away from you. Clean one strip at a time. When you’ve pulled all the dirt to one end of the stage, use the mop to pick up the dirt and deposit it into the water bucket. Do not walk on the marley until it is dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using marley alongside soft goods, always roll marley out first. When you need to sweep and mop the marley while soft goods are in, fly the goods out about a foot. This will allow you to clean the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Striking the Marley&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Striking marley is far easier than laying it. If there are soft goods hanging that touch the floor, sweep the stage and strike the soft goods first. Then:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sweep and mop one last time. Wait for the marley to dry. DO NOT roll the marley up if it is wet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove all of your tape. (Make a giant tape ball, if you’d like! Play with it, name it, take it home, and shower it with unconditional love. Don’t shower with it.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your PVC pipes. Always roll panels stage left to stage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting downstage left (Strip #7), tape the edge of the marley to your PVC pipe at three points; top, center and bottom (Strips #7 and #6 have unique edges that will only need one or two strips of tape to anchor them to the PVC pipe).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are taping the marley to the pipe in a way that will allow you to roll the marley in a straight line the entire length of the floor.  One side should always be flush with the pipe edge but not overextending over the end of the pipe edge.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you find that you have lost sight of the pipe on your straight edge, unroll and start over.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once you get to the end, make sure you still have the one exposed PVC pipe edge you’ve been working hard to maintain throughout the length of the roll.  This is the side the marley will stand on when stored upright.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If it looks good and your edge is straight, you’re ready to tape the rolled up marley to itself (again top, center, and bottom).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double check that it has not lost its label. If it has, make a new one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stand the rolled up marley in its home backstage right.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DO NOT store upright unsupported by the PVC pipe with the weight on the edge of the flooring itself. This will cause the ends to bend and crease in ways that will damage the marley long term.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;a-guide-to-the-performance-halls-soft-goods&quot;&gt;3. A Guide to the Performance Hall’s Soft Goods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What most people refer to as “curtains” are actually called “soft goods” within the technical theater community. As opposed to “hard goods,” soft goods have the capability to fold. These goods include items such as legs, borders, scrims, full stage blacks, and grand curtains (also referred to as main curtain). The Performance Hall at the University of Chicago has all of these. This section guides you through identifying, hanging, folding, and handling these various soft goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every soft good’s basic components are in relation to how it hangs on stage. A good’s top, bottom, back and front are easily identifiable even when folded. When one of these goods is set up on stage, the top refers to the end near the ceiling, the bottom to the end at the floor, the front refers to the side facing the audience, the back is the side the audience can’t see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the top of the good is a row of lengths of tie line. These tie lines are used to attach it to the pipe. When tying these lines to a batten, use a knot like tying your shoes. First, tie a simple half hitch, or what is commonly known as a single knot. Then, finish with a bow. Never tie a double knot. The ties on every good are all black except for one white tie; the white tie is your center tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hanging a soft good, first determine if it requires fullness or tautness (a loose or a tight look). Our borders and legs usually require fullness whereas our scrim and the full stage black need to be hung taut. Knots should be tight against the batten pipe unless instructed otherwise.  Never hang soft goods on a batten where they will be in direct contact with lights. This is a fire hazard. Talk to your supervisor and the visiting production team to determine a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top of the good is a handwritten label, naming the good and giving specifications related to the size of the good. When taking down and folding it, the label must always end up on the outside of the roll so future stagehands can easily identify it. You’ll notice only the Legs and Film Screen Masking curtains have chain at the bottom. The purpose of this chain is to stretch the good down to the stage and keep it from moving if touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always have a buddy or two helping when folding soft goods. It is possible to fold solo, but it is very, very hard. Before flying-in any soft good, first &lt;strong&gt;clear the deck&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;sweep the floor&lt;/strong&gt;! We want to keep our curtains looking tidy for a number of good reasons. Never walk on any of the soft goods with shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying-in any batten, pull together a ground crew to watch the pipe from stage level. While watching the pipe for possible collisions, your ground crew should also do an initial rough accordion folding of the curtain, making sure the front velour doesn’t accidentally fall forward onto the floor. Do not pull it too hard on the curtains as you fold them; you do not want to put too much stress on the rigging or move the pipe much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the batten has stopped moving, untie the goods and fly the pipe out again so there is nothing in the way while folding. Before you start moving the curtain around and spreading it out to fold, make sure all of the front is always face up and the back is face down. The back is a rougher texture than the velvety front, so it’s easy to tell the difference. It is important that the good rolls only on its back, so as to “save face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay the first curtain out flat onstage. Each good is folded differently, so have a clear plan on how you will fold each one before you do. Most of our curtains are folded bottom to top (as many times as needed) then rolled from one side to the other, as to fit into the bin, with the &lt;strong&gt;information label facing out&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folding (with your buddy) run one side’s corners to the other side’s corner trying to catch air in between the top and bottom sections. Capturing air also makes folding easier, resulting in less drag and allows you a few moments to fix problem areas with ease. Have a third person catching and realigning the center lines as they will be the biggest problems. Always remember to make sure your lines are even and edges match. Do not forget about the bottom half just because you can’t see it anymore! Each piece should be flat and even. If your fold has overshot the bottom edge, redo the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Legs are used to create wings. They come in pairs, one hung with fullness on each side of the stage on the same batten. The Performance Hall has four sets of legs. Keep each leg with its buddy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Prior to hanging legs, determine whether you need pipe extensions in each end of the batten.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Also, determine how far onstage the legs are needed for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First tie the onstage and offstage ties where you want them, then tie the center tie line. Now you have 2 identical sections that need their centers tied. Once those are tied, you will have 4 sections that need their centers tied. Continue to tie 50% marks until all ties are evenly spaced and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flying the batten out, the person running the rigging console is responsible for gathering a ground crew and ensuring that nothing crashes into the architecture. The ground crew (of at least 2 people) is responsible for watching the pipe and attachments, as well as physically unfolding the legs as they fly. ALWAYS have eyes on both ends of the batten as you fly it out so that you don’t damage the walls, ceiling, the battens or other people on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are dirty, stop flying them out and clean them as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person at scene control must stop the batten before it reaches its upper limit where it sits in its ceiling pocket. With the extensions in, it will not fit; it must sit below its home. Again, ALWAYS watch the batten as you raise it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the legs far enough out so their bottoms sit just barely on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk up to FOH to double check that they are evenly placed on stage. If they’re not perfectly even or end up covering the speakers, redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Legs&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the leg out the length of the stage, front side face up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legs are folded over twice (side to side), and then rolled bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once laid out, check where the label is on the top section. This side will remain on the floor as you fold toward it so it is on the outside when you put the leg away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one edge starts to cone inwards while the other cones out, unroll and reroll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware at this point that one side of the good may be thicker than the other. The thicker side should be kept as tight as possible. The other should loosen just enough to keep it even.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the rolled leg into the bin using the help of gravity. Tipping the bin and rolling the good inside will usually be harder than picking the good up and dropping it inside, but can be done if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Borders are used with legs to complete the proscenium look. They are also used to hide other things hanging in the air, such as lights &amp;amp; other things in the air. They run the width of the stage, but only hang down a few feet from the ceiling. Our borders are also used as a skirt to mask the bottom of the film screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s borders are stored in the same bins as the legs. Borders would normally be hung 1 pipe downstage of a set of legs, but because our space was designed with some oddities, there’s really only one good place to hang a border and that’s U3. U3 is special because it does not interfere with the lights.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as with the legs, use the 50% rule when tying the border to the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the batten out all the way, always keeping eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Borders&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The border itself is much longer than the width of the stage, so open the downstage panels to allow yourself more room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lay the border out so the center is farther offstage and prepare the first half by spreading it out and laying the onstage side flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold this edge to the center line evenly and then pull the border across the stage to give yourself room to repeat the process with the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flatten out the unfolded side and fold to the center line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that you have the whole thing fitting on stage, fold the bottom to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s impossible to keep the label on the outside of a border, since we’ve brought both ends to the center, so just keep track of which one you’re working with before rolling and binning it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borders aren’t as easy to lift, but they’re still liftable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Full Stage Black (FSB)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The full stage black is usually used to cover the upstage wall or to cut the depth of stage in half. In the Performance Hall, it can be hung from U3, U4, U6 and D-Light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Hanging Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the full stage black on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting at center and working offstage, tie every other tie until you reach the end of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back at center, pull your knots away from the center, pulling the fabric taut in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop when the bottom of the FSB rests on the deck of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Folding Full Stage Black&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold the good bottom to top, making sure to catch lots of air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this twice with the new bottom edge you have created, folding the good a total of three times, always bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the good so the label stays on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the hamper over and set it on it’s side, roll the good inside, and carefully tip it back up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You will need another person to do this, the hamper will now be very heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scrims (white and black)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Performance Hall has two scrims, a black scrim and a white scrim. They are stored in the same bin upstage but inside canvas bags to keep them from pilling on each other.  Unlike the other soft goods in the Performance Hall, scrims are used aesthetically, to both bounce and transmit light. They are often used in dance pieces, alongside a ground row of strip or cyc lights.  They are sometimes used as an alternate upstage projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the scrims are so light, they will need to be bottom-piped once they’re flown out. Bottom pipe can be found in the storage room across from the greenroom. They are the lightweight aluminum pipes that fit together, end to end. When bottom-piping the scrim, &lt;strong&gt;make sure the pipe sits in the inner nylon pocket, not the outer fabric pocket.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrims are hung and folded in the same manner as the full stage black. When hanging, start in the center and work your way off stage then go back and pull tautness into the fabric. When folding, fold bottom to top 3 times before rolling toward the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hampers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All of the Performance Hall’s soft goods are stored in hampers that live along the upstage wall backstage. Each hamper is labelled according to its contents. The hampers are only just small enough to pass through the upstage corridor and downstage doors to the stage. Be careful when moving them, as their hinges may catch on the architecture. For extra precaution, open panels to get the bins onstage. Determine whether you need to lay the bin on its side before loading or unloading goods. If you do, lay it down with its open lid on the floor. Be aware of the locks! Be extremely careful to not scratch the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;genie-use--safety&quot;&gt;4. Genie Use &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To use the genie&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;projection-crestron--amx&quot;&gt;5. Projection: Crestron &amp;amp; AMX&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two different systems/methods to connect video content to the digital projector, Crestron and AMX. You have to understand the signal flow of each system before deciding which one to use. There are only 2 inputs to the AMX system outside the projection booth, both located at the FOH desk. Crestron, on the other hand, has system at 6 different inputs around the room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is very important to note that the AMX system sends it’s audio out of the line array whereas the Crestron system sends to the EVs, aka “the mains”. Obviously, you’ll want to make sure that you have the correct speaker system flown into the space when you plug into the projector or your audio content will be muffled, distant and reverberant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Crestron System&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Crestron&lt;/strong&gt; is a control system that allows us to control multiple audio-visual devices from a single interface. In the Performance Hall, we have two Crestron touch screens: at FOH and the Stage Manager Console. We use Crestron to connect audio and video from and to various places throughout the space. Be aware that the Stage Manager Console touch screen has some advanced features that the FOH one does not have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to connect properly, you must understand all the inputs and outputs of the system. Inputs include Crestron labeled HDMI, VGA, ⅛” and RCA jacks (found in AVPs and floor boxes). Outputs include the digital projector, LCD screens in the upper and lower Gidwitz lobbies and the viewing monitor at the Stage Manager console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Volume Control&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The master volume control is at the bottom/center of each touchscreen. Be mindful of where your master volume level is set when testing; always start quiet and increase as needed. Each volume control also has it’s own mute button.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also choose the “Volume” button at the bottom right corner for more options. The first tab of the Volume page will give you your Presentation Source volume as well as the 3 RCA connections found in downstage floor boxes. The second tab of the Volume page will give you volume control for all 6 Utility mics (“U” inputs as opposed to “M” inputs) also found in the same downstage floor boxes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Understanding “Sources” and “Destinations”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The function of routing inputs and outputs is only available at the Stage Manager Console. From the Presentation Sources tab, choose the technician mode button at the bottom right corner and enter the password: 5540. You will then be brought to a deeper routing section that is divided into two sections: Source and Destination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sources are all inputs to the system; the HDMI or VGA inputs on stage, FOH and the Stage Manager Console as well as the Auditorium camera and the BluRay player in the Stage Manager Console rack. The Destinations are all the outputs to the system; the Auditorium Projector (which is the digital projector in the Projection Booth), the Stage Manager Monitor, and the LCD screens in the lobbies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to “soft patch” the connection, first select the “Source” then the “Destination” simply by pressing the buttons on screen.  Once connected, the source name will show up in the box just below the destination.  When soft patching, take a quick glance at all the other patches connected and make sure you still want those connections live - deactivate if not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Signal to the Lobby TV screens&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Using the primary Crestron touchscreen, press the Technician button and enter the password: 5540. Once you’re in, select the Source you’ve plugged into, then choose the Destinations labeled “LCD Auditorium” and “LCD LL Lobby” (lower level lobby). Next, go out and manually switch over the inputs on the screens by pressing the “input” button at the bottom of the TV until you reach the HDMI input holding your content.  At the end of the night, switch it back to the digital signage reel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Video to the Projector through Crestron&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you connect through Crestron, make sure you choose the correct input on the Crestron touch screen under Presentation Sources. There are 3 inputs on the stage (“Down Stage Left, Center and Right”), one at FOH (called the “In House Mix Input”), one at the Stage Manager Console (“Stage Mgr Input”), and one in the Projection Booth (“Control Booth Input”).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your device connected and soft patched to Crestron, turn the projector on using the AMX touch screen at FOH. Choose “Turn On System and Projector” and enjoy a moment of zen while waiting approximately 1 minute before the systems turns on. Once the system is on, tell AMX to “talk” to Crestron, by going to the ‘Sources’ tab, selecting ‘Crestron’, then pressing ‘Go Live’. After a few seconds, the connected source should display on the Projector Screen (or the back wall). Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sending Video to the Projector through AMX&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you use the Mac Mini at FOH to bring up your projection content, you’ll be connecting directly to the AMX system through DVI-1. There is also a DVI-2 cable floating around on the control desk for laptop connection. Remember, if you are connecting through DVI to the AMX system, you need to have the line array in the system. Do not connect to the AMX system directly if you do not have an audio engineer on hand, you won’t have audio without their help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have your content on the Mac Mini conrol display, your audio engineer at your side, and the AMX system is powered on, take your video content and drag it over to the Lillyput display to the left of the main display. On the AMX touch screen, choose “Sources”, DVI-1, “Go Live” and within a few seconds you should see your content on the back wall or projection screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Turning off the Projector&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The lamp on the digital projector is a beast; it runs at around 38,000 lumens. It’s expensive as hell and only lasts about 600 hours total. When you’re using projection, remember to turn it off when you’re not planning on using it for a while. To do this, on the AMX touch screen, choose Utility, then System &amp;amp; Projector Off. Confirm again that you want to shut down and it will begin it’s 4 minute cooling process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;working-a-show-your-duties&quot;&gt;6. Working a Show: Your Duties&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always check the &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; to see what company you’ll be working with for your shift. If you’re lucky, the visiting artists have been responsive, thought ahead, and had the foresight to fully plan out their performance details.  If so, a basic rundown of what needs to be done will be in the calendar notes section. Make a mental note of these tasks and be prepared to accomplish all. Ask questions ahead of time if you have any, such as “Do we need to check out any gear from the cage?” or “What time is the talent arriving?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clocking in and out&lt;/strong&gt; is important; don’t mess this part up or HR will start to dislike you as a person. They are the ones that write your checks, so seriously, don’t mess this part up. It’s your responsibility to remember to do this. If for some reason you forgot to clock in or out at the right time, immediately send an email to Erin detailing the time/date that you did clock in/out vs the time/date that you were supposed to clock in/out.  Words like “today”, “yesterday” and “last Monday” don’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the Stagehand Tips and Tricks, you should dress appropriately to each crew call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as an event on the “Performance” calendar, do not fail to dress the part.  If you are normally backstage, you must wear black head to toe. If you know you will be sitting at front of house, you can either wear all blacks or professional clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as something on the “Rehearsal” calendar, feel free to relax those standards a bit.  If nothing else is scheduled coinciding with your shift, you can expect tech work and should wear more comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you complete your tasks quickly and see others still working, go lend them a hand. This is not a union house–you can cross between departments. Whoever you may be, meet up with the rest of the crew or the members of a visiting production team. Understand what is expected of you throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the show, even if you do not have anything to do for a while, do not busy yourself with homework, reading, or facebook. Your actions distract audience members and artists while you end up looking lazy to the other professionals. Watch and pay attention to the show. You never know what is going to happen on stage and if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss your cue. If you cannot spare four or six hours to work a show, then you should not take the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be extra quiet while a performance is taking place.  The hall was designed with acoustics in mind. Someone speaking at a normal volume on stage can be heard throughout the entire room.  Remember this when talking through clear com at the FOH position, especially during quieter parts of the show. With a headset on, what might seem like a whisper to you can be heard by everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you need to walk away from your post for a moment, let the rest of the crew know by saying, “[your name] going off headset.” Give the other crew members a second to respond in case they have something important to say before you go. When you return, let them know you’re back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, always act professionally. Your actions reflect the entire crew, your bosses, the venue and building.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Manager&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Out of all the members of the crew on the show call, congratulations, you have the most duties. You are the liaison between the crew and the performers. All stage management duties follow a logic of making a show run smoothly. Communicate with your crew and the visiting production team and you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, go up to Erin’s office and get the stage management keys. Keep them on you for the rest of the night. Don’t forget to return them at the end of the night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the space, propping open backstage doors and the green room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock the backstage cabinet.  Make sure it stays closed throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Scene Control, the stage manager console, and the amp room sequencer (plus sub amp).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your backstage monitor at the stage manager console. Make sure that there are no banners in the way and that the camera is in focus so you can see the stage. If you can’t see anything on your monitor, check in with your supervisor or other crew members. They can help you fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the board operators and visiting production team. While the board ops are in charge of discussing their specific needs, you should have a general grasp of what is happening on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find out if the group has any digital materials. While digital files for projection or audio playback should be handed over to your board ops, digital signage for the lobby LCD screens will be inserted by you at the Stage Manager console. (More on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternately, you can send the live camera feed to the lobby monitors after rehearsals are finished, once the stage has cleared and house is open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a copy of the program. If there is none, speak with someone from the team and build one out. Take notes on entrances, exits, and cues (both light and sound). Some groups will provide their own cue sheet. Determine the entire show flow:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time is the show supposed to start?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time should the doors open to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there an intermission? If so, for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When is the show scheduled to end?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who will be walking onto stage, when and from where? Do they need mics?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your clearcom backstage. Your headset, pack, and cable are in the drawer in the stage management console. Spares are in the upstage right cabinet.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do a clearcom check with your board operators. Have them go on headset. Check if you can hear one another, your volumes are set properly and your call buttons work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right after doors are open, put the DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR sign on the back of the downstage left door. From this point on, YOU are the only person allowed to open this door. DO NOT let anyone (even Bill or Obama) run past you onto stage without clearing it with lighting and sound first. FOH relies on you heavily to start the show only after they are ready. Own this door, it’s yours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk over to the green room and inform performers that the house is now open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five minutes prior to show, give a 5 minute warning to members of the cast and crew. If performers request more time, let your house staff know if they need to hold doors or if the show will start late.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your first performers backstage. Keep them backstage and ready to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the show is ready to start, tell your friends at FOH to begin the process of house lights to half. This will notify the audience to take their seats and prepare for the start of the show. Allow one minute for everyone to get settled and then request the lighting operator to bring the house lights all the way out and into the first lighting look - usually stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for confirmation that the light change is in progress and send out your performers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the performers are out, close the inner vestibule doors as to isolate sound from the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.  Cross out movements/acts as they finish to stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the backstage left monitor for stage movement. Be ready and open the door if someone is walking offstage.  Make sure you actually open the door before they get close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If handing out wireless microphones, remember to check that they are on/have full battery strength before handing them out. Confirm with your sound board op as to which mic you’ve given out. Make sure you get the mic back when the person exits stage, turn it off if it won’t be in use again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are nervous the person using the mic will accidentally turn it off during their performance, or if the sound board operator has requested it, put a sleeve on the microphone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help nervous actors, musicians and other talent by being a calming force. Exude confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are the backstage point person throughout the entire show, help talent with anything they need - water, towel, safety pin, costume change, even a bucket to puke in (use a lined garbage can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return your ClearCom &amp;amp; cable to its drawer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help other strike what needs to be struck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the hall usable for the next day’s crew. For example, if you used the piano but the next crew will not, return it to instrument storage. If you didn’t use the piano but they will, bring it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up and throw away any garbage or show specific paperwork. Empty the trash bin backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to return any personal items left behind.  If the group is long gone, leave these items with the lost and found at the North Desk and tell the building manager on duty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everyone has cleared out, make sure all 3 entrances are closed and locked, as well as the green room entrances, storage closets, and stage door.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you turned on scene control, turn it off and reconnect its key with the stage manager key set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IMPORTANT: DO NOT FORGET to return the stage manager key set to Erin’s office. The next morning’s crew will not be able to do anything without this key set and will have to hunt you down. Public shaming will ensue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, logistical mishaps, or mischievous deviants, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report instead if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Light Board Operator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue * Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take notes on lighting cues needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure EP LOCKOUT is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with the stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sound Board Operator&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover and turn on the Venue SC48; store the cover under the console.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the sequencer (the key in the upper section of the left rack in the patchbay). Also, turn on the sub amp (the lower right hand section of the rack) by pressing the on button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with visiting artists their music, video, and whether they need any equipment.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your archival recording and test that it is getting level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always set up a backup wireless mic on a straight stand off stage left (in a place where the audience won’t see them every time the stage door opens) to easily deal with any last minute mic requests.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the batteries are fresh if you are about to go into a show.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Use half-life batteries if you are in a rehearsal.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Throw dead batteries into the dead battery bin.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Microphones:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Set up requested microphones backstage and/or onstage.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fly speakers in to the appropriate height based on the type of performance.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Fly in the banners if there will be amplified music or speaking.  Make sure you do not fly banners in front of the stage camera or the projection window if projection will be in use.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If using wireless mics, check all batteries and consider sleeving the mics.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Patch microphones in the patch bay from your “M” inputs on stage to the Venue by using the TRS cables hanging in the amp room (the red, green, and black cords).&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Monitors:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Always set up monitors if someone will be singing through a microphone on stage.  Often, instrumental groups with multiple mics will want monitors in order to hear each other better.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Patch monitors in the speakon patchbay, from Venue outputs to stage inputs, using the short CROSSWIRED speakon cables found in the amp room only. DO NOT use regular speakon cable - they are wired differently and can damage the gear.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Soundcheck:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Before the band arrives, if possible, do a line check to make sure that each microphone and monitor is passing signal.  To line check, have your audio assistant speak into each mic, one at a time, in order to pre-set general gains. Deal with phantom needs and troubleshoot any patching issues.  Next, have your assistant stand near each monitor while you send signal, one at a time, to confirm the monitors are patched correctly.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It is good practice to ring out the monitors before the artists arrive as well.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Once the band arrives, start sound checking each mic, focusing on one instrument at a time. If you are checking drums, have the drummer go through his whole kit, one drum/cymbal at a time, while you work with the EQ, comp, gate, etc for each one.  After you have them all dialed in, ask him/her to play the whole set so that you can further tweak (pan, groups, hi-pass, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the musician is hearing the right amount of everything through their monitor; don’t move on to the next musician until each person is happy. If they specifically ask for “everything” it’s important that you don’t give them everything.  In this situation, only give them the most important aspects for clarity’s sake (themselves, vocals, kick drum, lead guitar, whatever that might be).  If you give them everything, they’ll need more of everything and it will become a huge mess.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are mixing a digital instrument such as keyboard, dj rig or sampler, ask them to reproduce their loudest patch so that you can set your gain to that level.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you finish with the last musician and everyone seems happy with their rough mixes, ask the whole group to play a half song together while you walk the room to hear the mix from different listening perspectives - tweak issues accordingly.  When the group stops playing, they will have many requests, deal with each request, one at a time.  Once everyone seems happy, ask them to try a different half song and repeat the whole process until they are happy with the stage mix and you are happy with the house mix.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure audio cables (only cables that will stay in place for the whole show) are taped down when in high traffic walk ways - brown gaff tape onstage, black offstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there will be any videographers in house and whether or not they need a board feed. Set that up for them ahead of time.  If the videographer shows up after doors are open, you will not be able to send them a feed down to the lower level.  They will have to record from the upper level next to FOH. Make sure their power cables do not run across the house walkways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are tasked with recording the performance, remember to PRESS RECORD(!!) in the minutes leading up to the start of the show. Make sure the device is actually recording and picking up signal.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program, and any notes you’ve taken, to make sure you turn the correct mic on each time someone is about to speak and then mute it when they travel off stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Communicate with the stage manager, especially when mics are coming on and off the stage throughout the show so you know which mics to take live.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use good judgment when deciding whose mics to mute during panels and Q&amp;amp;A’s. Sometime panelists will make a lot of noise when they aren’t speaking, so it might be good to mute their mics if someone else is speaking for a long period of time. To do this well, you will have to have all your fingers on the mutes or faders ready to pull the trigger before they decide to speak up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use your headphones to solo channels in order to find any problem areas that you notice now but didn’t notice during soundcheck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Leave your ClearCom in a visible place so that you can see calls coming in. The stage manager may need to reach you to communicate, and without that visual you may never know.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mute the audio console and head down to stage to begin strike. Play some quiet music if you’d like.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Before doing anything, attempt to troubleshoot any issues you realized during the show. Test suspect mics, cables, patches, systems, channels, etc before striking. Immediately, send an email to Erin about the problem, when it happened, how you dealt with it and the current status.  Leave the broken gear up in #243 on the secondary desk in Erin’s office.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Strike all mics, monitors, stands and cable and restore them to their default “home” positions. Remember to keep mic clips with their mic and mic bag, not with the stand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull up all your tape from the floor.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you made an archival recording:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  * Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stagehand&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assistance with costume changes
Other duties include:&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping other crew members with their set-ups.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Before the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a program and take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;During the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls. Don’t pay attention to your phone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During your scene changes:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move quickly and with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;After the Show&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike and clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we’re not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A/D Converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Analog to digital converter, a device that transforms incoming analog signals into digital signals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for After Fade Listen, another way of saying post-fader solo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Send:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer bus output designed to send a signal to an auxiliary processor or monitor system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer input with limited control capabilities, intended for bringing the output of an auxiliary processor or other line-level source into the main mix bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Input:&lt;/strong&gt; An input consists of two leads, neither of which is common to the circuit ground. This is a “differential pair”, where the signal consists of the difference in voltage between the two leads. Balanced input circuits can offer excellent rejection of common-mode noise induced into the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Output:&lt;/strong&gt; In a classic balanced audio circuit, the output is carried on two leads (high/+ and low/-) which are isolated from the circuit ground by exactly the same impedance. A symmetrical balanced output carries the same signal at exactly the same level but of opposite polarity with respect to ground. A special case of a balanced output carries the signal on only one lead, with the other lead being at zero voltage with respect to ground, but at the same impedance as the signal-carrying lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;: The band of frequencies that pass through a device with a loss of less than 3dB, expressed in Hertz or in musical octaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardioid:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart-shaped. In sound work, cardioid refers to the shape of the sensitivity vs. direction plot for a particular style of directional microphone. A cardioid mic rejects sound arriving from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel:&lt;/strong&gt; A functional path in an audio circuit: an input channel, an output channel, a recording channel, the left channel and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel strip:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical realization of an audio channel on the front panel of a mixer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipping:&lt;/strong&gt; A form of severe audio distortion that results from peaks of the audio signal attempting to rise above the capabilities of the amplifier circuit. To avoid clipping, reduce the system gain in or before the gain stage in which the clipping occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressor:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a dynamic processor used to smooth out any large transient peaks in an audio signal that might otherwise overload your system or cause distortion. The amplitude threshold and other parameters such as attack time, release time, and ratio are adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condenser:&lt;/strong&gt; Condenser microphones require electrical power to run internal amplifiers and maintain an electrical charge on the capacitor. They are typically powered by internal batteries or “phantom power” supplied by an external source, such as a mixing console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cueing:&lt;/strong&gt; In broadcast, stage and post-production work, to “cue up” a sound or video source (a record, a sound effect on a CD, a song on a tape) means to get it ready for playback by making sure you are in the right position on the “cue,” making sure the level and EQ are all set properly. This requires a special monitoring circuit that only the mixing engineer hears. It does not go out on the air or to the main mixing buses. Cueing can also refer to a similar process regarding video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D/A converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital-to-analog converter, a device that transforms incoming digital signal into analog form.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decibel (dB):&lt;/strong&gt; A unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound work, delay usually refers to an electronic circuit or effects unit whose purpose it is to delay the audio signal for some short period of time. Delay can refer to one short repeat, a series of repeats or the complex interactions of delay used in chorusing or reverb. When delayed signals are mixed back with the original sound, a great number of audio effects can be generated, including phasing and flanging, doubling, Haas precedence-effect panning, slap or slapback, echo, regenerative echo, chorusing and hall-like reverberation. Signal time delay is central to many audio effects units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually means without reverberation, or without some other applied effect like delay or chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic microphone:&lt;/strong&gt; The class of microphones that generate electrical signals by the movement of a coil in a magnetic field. Dynamic microphones are rugged, relatively inexpensive, capable of very good performance and do not require external power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equalization (EQ):&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to purposefully changing the frequency response of a circuit, sometimes to correct for previous unequal response (hence the term, equalization), and more often to boost or cut the level at certain frequencies for sound enhancement, to remove extraneous sounds, or to create completely new and different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of times an event repeats itself in a given period of time. The audio frequency range is generally considered to be 20 Hz to 20, 000 Hz. This covers the fundamental pitch and most overtones of musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; The measure of how much a circuit amplifies a signal. Gain may be stated as a ratio of input to output voltage, current or power, such as a voltage gain of 4, or a power gain of 1.5, or it can be expressed in decibels, such as a line amplifier with a gain of 10dB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate:&lt;/strong&gt; A dynamics processor that automatically turns off an input signal when it drops below a certain level. This can reduce the overall noise level of your mix by turning off inputs when they are not in use. Threshold, attack time, hold, and release time are some of the adjustable gate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A graphic equalizer uses slide pots for its boost/cut controls, with its operating frequencies evenly spaced through the audio spectrum. In a perfect world, a line drawn through the centers of thecontrol shafts would form a graph of the frequency response curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; Also called earth. Ground is defined as the point of zero voltage in a circuit or system, the reference point from which all other voltages are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In electrical power systems, ground connections are used for safety purposes, to keep equipment chassis and controls at zero voltage and to provide a safe path for errant currents. This is called a safety ground. Maintaining a good safety ground is essential to prevent electrical shock.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In sensitive electronic equipment, tiny currents and voltages riding on the ground (so it’s not truly zero volts) can cause noise in the circuits and hamper operation. Often a ground separate from the power ground is used as the reference point for the electronics, isolating the sensitive electronics from the dirty power ground. This is called a technical ground.
Hertz: The unit of frequency, equal to 1 cycle per second. Abbreviated Hz. kHz = 1000 Hz, and is usually pronounced “kay” (with “Hertz” implied) by sound professionals who ask for “a little more two and a half K” when they want you to boost 2.5 kHz (2500Hz).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impedance:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure of the AC resistance, capacitance, and inductance in an electrical circuit, measured in ohms;; all of these three properties impede the flow of current. AKA: the higher the impedance, the lower the current. In audio circuits (and other AC circuits) the impedance in ohms can often be much different from the circuit resistance as measured by a DC ohmmeter. Maintaining proper circuit impedance relationships is important to avoid distortion and minimize added noise.
Level: Another word for signal voltage, power, strength or volume. Audio signals are sometimes classified according to their level. Commonly used levels are: microphone level (-40 dBu or lower), instrument level (-20 to -10 dBu), and line level (-10 to +30 dBu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;￼￼￼￼￼&lt;strong&gt;Line level:&lt;/strong&gt;  A signal whose level falls between -10 dBu and +30 dBu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main (house) speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; The main loudspeakers for a sound reinforcement system. These are usually the largest and loudest loudspeakers, and are usually positioned so that their sound seems to come from the area of the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master:&lt;/strong&gt; A control affecting the final output of a bus on which one or more signals are mixed. A mixer may have several master controls, which may be slide faders or rotary controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic level:&lt;/strong&gt; The typical level of a signal from a microphone. A mic level signal (usually but not always coming from a microphone) is generally lower than -30 dBu. With a very quiet source (a pin dropping?) the signal can be -70 dBu or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic preamp:&lt;/strong&gt; Short for microphone preamplifier. An amplifier whose job is to bring the very low microphone level signal up to line level, or in the case of a mic preamp built into a mixer, the mixer’s internal operating level (approximately 0 dBu). Mic preamps often have their own volume control, called a trim control, to properly set the gain for a particular source. Setting the mic preamp gain correctly with the trim control is an essential step in establishing good signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient headroom for your mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound reinforcement, monitor speakers (or monitor headphones or in-the-ear monitors) are
those speakers used by the performers to hear themselves. In recording, the monitor speakers are those used by the engineer and production staff to listen to the recording as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever you don’t want to hear. Could be hum, buzz or hiss;; could be crosstalk or digital hash or your neighbor’s stereo;; could be white noise or pink noise or brown noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; A wiring method which electrically ties together two jacks or two poles of one jack so that in normal operation, there is signal flow between them. Inserting a plug breaks this connection, allowing the signal path to be modified. Normal wiring is common in patchbays and insert jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PA:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Public Address. An electronic amplification system used as a communication system in public areas. Today, people who work with PA systems like to say they’re working in “sound reinforcement”. Pan, pan pot: Short for panoramic potentiometer. A pan pot is used to position (or even dynamically move) a monaural sound source in a stereo mixing field by adjusting the source’s volume between the left and right channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch bay:&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of usually a large number of jacks allowing convenient access to various points in a system’s interconnect wiring. A patch bay can make re-routing signals very convenient without having to fish around with cables in the back of racks or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parametric EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A “fully” parametric EQ is an extremely powerful equalizer that allows smooth, continuous, and independent control of each of the three primary EQ parameters: frequency, gain, and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for Pre Fade Listen. Sound folks call it being able to solo a channel with the fader down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Power:&lt;/strong&gt; A system of providing electrical power for condenser microphones (and some electronic pickup devices) from the microphone input jack;; it provides +48V across two pins in a 3-pin XLR. The system is called phantom because the power is carried on standard microphone audio wiring in a way that is “invisible” to ordinary dynamic microphones. Generally, phantom power is safe to use with non-condenser microphones as well, especially dynamic microphones. However, unbalanced microphones, some electronic equipment (such as some wireless microphone receivers) and some ribbon microphones can short out the phantom power and be severely damaged. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; The time relationship between two signals, expressed in degrees around a circle. 0 and 360 degrees represents an in-phase relationship – both signals change in the same way at the same time. Anything else
is out of phase. 180 degrees out of phase is a special case which, for a continuous waveform, means that at any given time the two signals have the same amplitude but are opposite in polarity. The phase reverse switch found on some mixers or mic preamps actually reverses the signal polarity. When out-of-phase signals are mixed, there will be some cancellation at certain frequencies, the frequencies and the degree of cancellation being a function of the amount of phase shift and the relative amplitude of the signals. Attention to mic placement and careful listening will allow you to use this effect creatively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is not affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A return is a mixer line input dedicated to the task of returning processed or added sound from reverb, echo and other effects devices. Depending on the internal routing of your mixer and your own inclination, you could use returns as additional line inputs, or you could route your reverb outputs to ordinary line inputs rather than the returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverb:&lt;/strong&gt; The sound remaining in a room after the source of sound is stopped. Reverberation and echo are terms that are often used interchangeably, but in audio parlance a distinction is usually made: reverberation is considered to be a diffuse, continuously smooth decay of sound, whereas echo is one or more distinct, recognizable repetitions of a word, note, phrase or sound which decreases in amplitude with every repeat. Highly reverberant rooms are called live;; rooms with very little reverberation are called dead. A sound source without added reverb is dry;; one with reverb or echo added is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal-to-noise ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a specification that describes how much noise an audio component has compared to the signal. It is usually expressed in dB below a given output level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surround sound:&lt;/strong&gt; Multi-channel audio playback systems in 6, 8, or 10-channel formats. Surround sound is typically found in movie theaters and home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Ring-Sleeve, the three parts of a two-conductor (plus shield) phone plug. Since the plug or jack can carry two signals and a common ground, TRS connectors are often referred to as stereo or balanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Sleeve, the two parts of a single conductor (plus shield) phone plug. TS connectors are sometimes called mono or unbalanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbalanced:&lt;/strong&gt; An electrical circuit in which the two legs of the circuit do not have the identical impedance to ground. Often one leg is also at ground potential. Unbalanced circuit connections require only two conductors (signal “hot” and ground). Unbalanced audio circuitry is less expensive to build, but under certain circumstances is more susceptible to noise pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/8/28/projection-cheat-sheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;###BASIC&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SOURCE = MacMini or FOH HDMI&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the Switcher Rack On (Black on / off flip switch, right side)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On the AMX Touch interface, hit “Turn on system and projector”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Open Chrome on the Mac Mini and Open the Kumo Bookmark&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Click Projector on the Bottom Row&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Select your source on the Top Row&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Hs68lLj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;#####If that doesn’t get you an image now we start:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;TROUBLESHOOTING&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are actually sending some sort of image from your source: (very helpful to have the preview monitor at FOH set to the same source as the projector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source is the mac mini, try dragging a window to the right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a different source, make sure your display preferences are set up correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the lamp of the projector is actually on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Chrome, open the &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; bookmark. On the top left side there will be a little button that says Lamp and it will have on and off buttons on either side of the label. Make sure “ON” is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the image is not muted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xncCve2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Two&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###INTERMEDIATE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####SOURCE = STAGE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THE &lt;strong&gt;BASIC&lt;/strong&gt; INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Decimator, its power adaptor, and one of the long Blue SDI Cables* from Janice [When using the SDI cables, be gentle with them, be careful not to kink them, and please coil them properly when striking] . You may also need an extension cord and / or a power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get whatever adaptors / other cables you need to be able send an HDMI signal to the Decimator from your source. (Probably a Thunderbolt to HDMI, or DVI to HDMI)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect one end of the Blue SDI Cable to the SDI OUTPUT on the Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the other end of the SDI Cable to one of the AVP Patch Points (If Downstage Right, use AV12, and run the cable up over the doorway.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your source HDMI cable to the Decimator’s HDMI INPUT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that your AVP Patch point (the one to which you connected the Blue SDI cable) is patched to AV38 in the patchbay (The default patching is AV12 to AV38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the KUMO Routing Interface (Chrome), select Projector on the Bottom Row and STAGE on the Top Row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get you an image. If it doesn’t, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;#troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; section above.
section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if none of that works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check Your SDI Patching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the Decimator is on (the screen will be lit).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the BNC Patching in the Patchbay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure AV38 at FOH is actually connected to something, it should be SDI input #3 on the back of the AJA in the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####REFOCUSING / SIZING THE IMAGE (Basic/ Without Presets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the projector interface on chrome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Basic Control” tab on the left&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the sets of arrows to adjust the image according to what you need&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For this you only have coarse adjust:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you click an arrow it will continue to adjust in that direction until you click the square in the center of the arrows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also, when focusing, try and have someone on stage close to the screen (or whatever you’re projecting onto) to confirm the focusing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/5Jrk0p3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Three&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####REFOCUSING / SIZING (Intermediate / With Presets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do all the same things you can do from the web interface, and more, from the projection booth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into the projection booth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the computer is on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The computer is in the left rack, underneath the HDCam players, and underneath the screen that pulls out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s a 1U rack unit with a disk drive on the left and a “SuperLogics” logo, there is a red power button on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push the power button and the fan will start up, letting you know that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull out the screen drawer (the black handle on the rack unit above the computer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;DCCs2&lt;/strong&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the communication settings window, make sure &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; is selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IP Address is:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.134&lt;/code&gt; Port is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;43728&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hx6h4VI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Four&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click OK (Also, the projector must be on in order to communicate with it. If it’s not on, nothing further will work. &lt;em&gt;And how were you planning to size an image if it’s off anyways?&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/O1bGrL9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Five&quot; /&gt;
7. Once the communication loading bar has completed and gone away, click the &lt;strong&gt;lens&lt;/strong&gt; tab at the top.
8. From the lens tab you have access to the focusing and resizing adjustments, as well as Fine Adjust mode, and &lt;em&gt;presets&lt;/em&gt;
	* SAVING A PRESET&lt;/p&gt;

 		* Make all the image adjustments you need
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Memory List&lt;/strong&gt; button to access the list of presets, then click a new row under all the ones that currently exist
 		* Click &lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt;, and name your preset, once it’s named you’re all good
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LOADING A PRESET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		* Select the preset you want to load
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; button, and the preset will begin to load

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;####CONFIDENCE MONITORS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Confidence Monitors is sort of the opposite of running a source from the stage in terms of signal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out the Confidence Monitor rack case from Janice, grab one of the blue SDI cables, and get as many monitors and heavy duty DVI cables as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up the case where it will live during the show, it needs power and needs to be relatively close to both an AVP, and the monitors to which you will be running the DVI cables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the power cord for the rack supply, and turn the rack on. There should be blue and green lights that indicate that the unit is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the blue SDI cable to one of the AV patch points on the AVP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the patching in the patchbay is set up properly so that the AV patch point where you connected the SDI cable is hooked up to the point from where the signal at FOH is sending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the DVI cables from the back of the inside of the confidence monitor rack to the monitors you will be using, making sure to run the cable out of the way and to be gentle with the cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Guide to Soft Goods</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/soft-goods-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/soft-goods-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What most people refer to as “curtains” are actually called “soft goods” within the technical theater community. As opposed to “hard goods,” soft goods have the capability to fold. These goods include items such as legs, borders, scrims, full stage blacks, and grand curtains (also referred to as main curtain). The Performance Hall at the University of Chicago has all of these. This section guides you through identifying, hanging, folding, and handling these various soft goods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;anatomy-of-a-soft-good&quot;&gt;Anatomy of a Soft Good&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every soft good’s basic components are named in relation to how it hangs on stage. A good’s top, bottom, back and front are easily identifiable even when folded. When one of these goods is set up on stage, the top refers to the end near the ceiling, the bottom to the end at the floor, the front refers to the side facing the audience, the back is the side the audience can’t see.
Along the top of the good is a row of lengths of tie line. These tie lines are used to attach it to the pipe. When tying these lines to a batten, use a knot like tying your shoes. First, tie a simple half hitch, or what is commonly known as a single knot. Then, finish with a bow. Never tie a double knot. The ties on every good are all black except for one white tie; the white tie is your center tie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the top of the good is a handwritten label, naming the good and giving specifications related to the size of the good. When taking down and folding it, the label must always end up on the outside of the roll so future stagehands can easily identify it. You’ll notice only the Legs and Film Screen Masking curtains have chain at the bottom. The purpose of this chain is to stretch the good down to the stage and keep it from moving if touched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hanging&quot;&gt;Hanging&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When hanging a soft good, first determine if it requires fullness or tautness (a loose or a tight look). Our borders and legs usually require fullness whereas our scrim and the full stage black need to be hung taut. Knots should be tight against the batten pipe unless instructed otherwise.  Never hang soft goods on a batten where they will be in direct contact with lights. This is a fire hazard. Talk to your supervisor and the visiting production team to determine a compromise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;takedown--flying-soft-goods&quot;&gt;Takedown / Flying Soft Goods&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When flying-in any batten, pull together a ground crew to watch the pipe from stage level. While watching the pipe for possible collisions, your ground crew should also do an initial rough accordion folding of the curtain, making sure the front velour doesn’t accidentally fall forward onto the floor. Do not pull it too hard on the curtains as you fold them; you do not want to put too much stress on the rigging or move the pipe much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the batten has stopped moving, untie the goods and fly the pipe out again so there is nothing in the way while folding. Before you start moving the curtain around and spreading it out to fold, make sure all of the front is always face up and the back is face down. The back is a rougher texture than the velvety front, so it’s easy to tell the difference. It is important that the good rolls only on its back, so as to “save face.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;folding&quot;&gt;Folding&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should always have a buddy or two helping when folding soft goods. It is possible to fold solo, but it is very, very hard. Before flying-in any soft good, first clear the deck and sweep the floor! We want to keep our curtains looking tidy for a number of good reasons. Never walk on any of the soft goods with shoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lay the first curtain out flat onstage. Each good is folded differently, so have a clear plan on how you will fold each one before you do. Most of our curtains are folded bottom to top (as many times as needed) then rolled from one side to the other, as to fit into the bin, with the information label facing out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When folding (with your buddy) run one side’s corners to the other side’s corner trying to catch air in between the top and bottom sections. Capturing air also makes folding easier, resulting in less drag and allows you a few moments to fix problem areas with ease. Have a third person catching and realigning the center lines as they will be the biggest problems. Always remember to make sure your lines are even and edges match. Do not forget about the bottom half just because you can’t see it anymore! Each piece should be flat and even. If your fold has overshot the bottom edge, redo the fold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;legs&quot;&gt;Legs&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legs are used to create wings. They come in pairs, one hung with fullness on each side of the stage on the same batten. The Performance Hall has four sets of legs. Keep each leg with its buddy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Prior to hanging legs, determine whether you need pipe extensions in each end of the batten. Also, determine how far onstage the legs are needed for the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;First tie the onstage and offstage ties where you want them, then tie the center tie line. Now you have 2 identical sections that need their centers tied. Once those are tied, you will have 4 sections that need their centers tied. Continue to tie 50% marks until all ties are evenly spaced and secure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When flying the batten out, the person running the rigging console is responsible for gathering a ground crew and ensuring that nothing crashes into the architecture. The ground crew (of at least 2 people) is responsible for watching the pipe and attachments, as well as physically unfolding the legs as they fly. ALWAYS have eyes on both ends of the batten as you fly it out so that you don’t damage the walls, ceiling, the battens or other people on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are dirty, stop flying them out and clean them as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The person at scene control must stop the batten before it reaches its upper limit where it sits in its ceiling pocket. With the extensions in, it will not fit; it must sit below its home. Again, ALWAYS watch the batten as you raise it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the legs far enough out so their bottoms sit just barely on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk up to FOH to double check that they are evenly placed on stage. If they’re not perfectly even or end up covering the speakers, redo them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Legs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Spread the leg out the length of the stage, front side face up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Legs are folded over twice (side to side), and then rolled bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once laid out, check where the label is on the top section. This side will remain on the floor as you fold toward it so it is on the outside when you put the leg away.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If one edge starts to cone inwards while the other cones out, unroll and reroll.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware at this point that one side of the good may be thicker than the other. The thicker side should be kept as tight as possible. The other should loosen just enough to keep it even.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load the rolled leg into the bin using the help of gravity. Tipping the bin and rolling the good inside will usually be harder than picking the good up and dropping it inside, but can be done if needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;borders&quot;&gt;Borders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Borders are used with legs to complete the proscenium look. They are also used to hide other things hanging in the air, such as lights &amp;amp; other things in the air. They run the width of the stage, but only hang down a few feet from the ceiling. Our borders are also used as a skirt to mask the bottom of the film screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s borders are stored in the same bins as the legs. Borders would normally be hung 1 pipe downstage of a set of legs, but because our space was designed with some oddities, there’s really only one good place to hang a border and that’s U3. U3 is special because it does not interfere with the lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Just as with the legs, use the 50% rule when tying the border to the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fly the batten out all the way, always keeping eyes on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Borders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The border itself is much longer than the width of the stage, so open the downstage panels to allow yourself more room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lay the border out so the center is farther offstage and prepare the first half by spreading it out and laying the onstage side flat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold this edge to the center line evenly and then pull the border across the stage to give yourself room to repeat the process with the other side.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flatten out the unfolded side and fold to the center line&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Now that you have the whole thing fitting on stage, fold the bottom to the top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s impossible to keep the label on the outside of a border, since we’ve brought both ends to the center, so just keep track of which one you’re working with before rolling and binning it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Borders aren’t as easy to lift, but they’re still liftable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;full-stage-black-fsb&quot;&gt;Full Stage Black (FSB)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full stage black is usually used to cover the upstage wall or to cut the depth of stage in half. In the Performance Hall, it can be hung from U3, U4, U6 and D-Light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hanging Full Stage Black&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unroll the full stage black on the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Starting at center and working offstage, tie every other tie until you reach the end of the pipe.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Back at center, pull your knots away from the center, pulling the fabric taut in both directions.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stop when the bottom of the FSB rests on the deck of the stage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Folding Full Stage Black&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Fold the good bottom to top, making sure to catch lots of air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Repeat this twice with the new bottom edge you have created, folding the good a total of three times, always bottom to top.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Roll the good so the label stays on the outside.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Tip the hamper over and set it on it’s side, roll the good inside, and carefully tip it back up. You will need another person to do this, the hamper will now be very heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;scrims-white-and-black&quot;&gt;Scrims (white and black)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall has two scrims, a black scrim and a white scrim. They are stored in the same bin upstage but inside canvas bags to keep them from pilling on each other.  Unlike the other soft goods in the Performance Hall, scrims are used aesthetically, to both bounce and transmit light. They are often used in dance pieces, alongside a ground row of strip or cyc lights.  They are sometimes used as an alternate upstage projection surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because the scrims are so light, they will need to be bottom-piped once they’re flown out. Bottom pipe can be found in the storage room across from the greenroom. They are the lightweight aluminum pipes that fit together, end to end. When bottom-piping the scrim, make sure the pipe sits in the inner nylon pocket, not the outer fabric pocket.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scrims are hung and folded in the same manner as the full stage black. When hanging, start in the center and work your way off stage then go back and pull tautness into the fabric. When folding, fold bottom to top 3 times before rolling toward the label.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hampers&quot;&gt;Hampers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the Performance Hall’s soft goods are stored in hampers that live along the upstage wall backstage. Each hamper is labelled according to its contents. The hampers are only just small enough to pass through the upstage corridor and downstage doors to the stage. Be careful when moving them, as their hinges may catch on the architecture. For extra precaution, open panels to get the bins onstage. Determine whether you need to lay the bin on its side before loading or unloading goods. If you do, lay it down with its open lid on the floor. Be aware of the locks! Be extremely careful to not scratch the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Genie Use and Safety</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/genie-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/genie-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-safety-tips&quot;&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-use-the-genie&quot;&gt;To use the genie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-put-the-genie-away&quot;&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/recording/handheld-tascam-tutorial</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;initial-set-up&quot;&gt;Initial Set Up&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press and hold the Home button to turn on the Tascam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the battery indicator and replace if the battery is low.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to see if the SD card is actually in the device; if not, find one and insert it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;empty-the-memory-to-ensure-theres-enough-space-for-your-recording&quot;&gt;Empty the memory to ensure there’s enough space for your recording:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press menu button to get to the menu&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use plus or minus buttons to scroll down to others, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to system, press enter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Scroll down to quick format, press enter.  Exec, enter.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;“All data erased. Are you sure?” Press enter and you’re done.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Press menu to get back to the record screen and press the Rec Mode button to choose an input.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stay in “stereo” and then select your input under “source”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your source will be either “Internal microphone” or “External in 1&amp;amp;2” (your XLR 1&amp;amp;2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing menu again will bring you back to the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-three-methods-of-taking-a-recording-in-the-penthouse&quot;&gt;There are three methods of taking a recording in the Penthouse:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to test it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp;amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, send the file to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;erinbrenner@uchicago.edu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording to the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter Erin’s email address (above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your email address press Send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Node Configuration Instructions</title>

   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/lighting/node-configuration</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plug the node into the lighting network and write down the ip address taped to the side of the node&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a Mac (If you’re using a PC, you’re on your own…)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open System Preferences&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to the Network Preferences page&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Move the “Auditorium” Wi-Fi network&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click on Advanced towards the bottom right corner of the window&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go to the TCP/IP page&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In the drop down menu where it says “Configure IPv4” select “Manually”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give the computer an ip address of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.199&lt;/code&gt; (or any other ip address within the
lighting network but not used by an entity on that network)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Give the computer a Subnet Mask of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;255.255.255.0&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click Ok and then click Apply&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Open Firefox (other browsers are less successful at interacting with the strand
interface)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Type in the ip address of the mode where you would enter a web address + /mini/&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If the ip address is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.72&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Type in: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.0.72/mini/&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;There are only a few things that you should be changing in this screen, depending
upon what you are configuring the node to do:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can change whether the ports (DMX A and DMX B) output or input DMX by
going to their respective pages within this screen by clicking on them and then
selecting DMX in from the drop-down menu&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;You can change what DMX universe (set of 512 DMX channels—usually we’ll just
be using universes one and two to give the hall a total of 1024 addressable channels of lighting control) each port corresponds to by changing the “Netslot” field value of each port along the bottom of the window.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;To put a DMX port (A or B) in Universe 1, enter “1” for the “Netslot” For Universe 2, you would enter 513 for the “Netslot”&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;If you reconfigure the node, make sure to change the label for each DMX port to reflect what it is doing, (i.e. if you configure a port to be DMX in second universe, change the label to DMX IN U2)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Click Update to update the node with the changes you made. The password is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;2606&lt;/code&gt;. Go back to the DMX A and DMX B pages to make sure the desired changes held.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;After reconfiguring the node, for the changes to take effect, you frequently have to reboot the node by unplugging it from ethernet and then plugging it back in!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’re done! To make your computer connect to the regular internet again, go back to the Configure IPv4 drop down menu in system preferences and change it back to “Using DHCP” and apply the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>How to Be a Great Stagehand</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-basics&quot;&gt;The Basics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always arrive 10 minutes early for your call. If your call starts at 9am, that means you start working at 9am. Give yourself enough time to clock on, tool up, and get ready for work.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to stay busy during your work call. If you have nothing to do, ask your other crew members and supervisor if they need help doing anything.
*If no one needs help, keep yourself busy by working on something else like tidying backstage or the storage closets, sweeping or mopping the stage, returning tools to their homes, or organizing gels in the catwalks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’ve finished cleaning and your co-workers/supervisor still don’t need assistance, either ask for a break or spend the time getting more familiar with systems that you might not yet understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If someone walks into the space while you are staring at your phone, book or computer, it reflects badly on the entire crew and building.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;what-to-wear-and-not-wear&quot;&gt;What to Wear (and not wear)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;appropriate-dress&quot;&gt;Appropriate Dress&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Closed Toe shoes (no flip flops or birkenstocks)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clothes you can move comfortably in&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Full length pants&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Appropriate tools for the job (flashlight, crescent wrench, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long hair is tied back&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;inappropriate-dress-do-not-wear&quot;&gt;Inappropriate Dress (DO NOT WEAR)&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open-toed shoes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;High heels&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dangly jewelry&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Skirts or dresses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Torn or dirty clothes (unless it’s a tech day)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;more-notes&quot;&gt;More Notes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re working a show call and/or will be positioned backstage, wear all black (or as close as you can possibly get) with black/dark soft-soled shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NO shorts are allowed (unless it’s a tech day but even then, consider your knees).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re working at front of house, wear all black OR dark professional clothes: button down shirt, dress pants, nice shoes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;communication&quot;&gt;Communication&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t know how to do something, ask. It’s way better to spend more time on something during setup than to do something incorrectly if you’re unsure; we will all pay for it at showtime. Double/triple check everything you do and point out concerns or inconsistencies to the other crew members and supervisor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t be afraid to talk to those renting/using the spaces. Consider the implications of user requests before saying yes or no. If these requests are outside of your domain, bring that question to the right person:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Examples:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get access to the greenroom?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Yes.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we hang a curtain here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll have to ask my Stage Manager or Supervisor.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a 2nd wireless mic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll ask the audio engineer for you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a spotlight here?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    I’ll ask the lighting engineer for you.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can we get a table in the lobby for check in?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Yes. Then, go grab a table from 065 and bring it up to the lobby.
    If you’re short on time, or can’t follow through, reach out
    to Operations for support.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I peek through the stage door while people are in the house?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    No. Guide them to look at the video monitor at the Stage Manager
    Console instead (you have control over the camera, so you could
    scan the audience to get a feel for how crowded the house is).
    Otherwise, if they need a better view, tell them to sneak out
    into the lower vestibule and enter at the lower level entrance.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can I get a stage picture through the stage door?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;    Tell them to hold while you ask the person in charge of the event
    to approve this request. Opening the stage door for any reason
    other than an entrance will distract the audience, but in the
    end it’s up to the person running the show.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;general-shift-etiquette&quot;&gt;General Shift Etiquette&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While lightheartedness and laughter are crucial and help us all get through long hours of hard labor, remember that you’re here to work. Try not to goof off too much while on the clock. Socialize after work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are doing something that could potentially affect the entire crew, announce to everyone what you are doing. For example, if you are working in the catwalks or in a genie, shout, “Working overhead!” If you are bringing in a lineset, say, “Lineset moving!” or “U3 flying in!” Before you turn off all the lights off on stage or in the house, you should shout “Going dark!”. Always wait for acknowledgement from others in the space in the form of “Thank you!” before executing the change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there are patrons or members of the cast on stage or in the house and you need to be working up in the catwalks on lighting, check with your supervisor first. It may be better to wait until the space is empty. However, if time is tight, as it can often be, you may have to work despite others being in the way. Make sure those directly below you have cleared the area before continuing to work over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;finding-covers&quot;&gt;Finding Covers&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you cannot make a shift for some reason, text/email other members of the crew to find a replacement. Let your manager know immediately. Your shift is your responsibility, so even if you have other things going on, get sick, injured or realize your have a paper due in the morning, you must find a cover because the show must go on. Be very careful when finding a cover because they must have the same skill set you do in order to do your job. Double check with this person the day before the shift to make sure they are still covering for you. If for some reason they fall through, it falls on you. Even one “incident” could put you into suspension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;physical-hazards--how-to-be-safe&quot;&gt;Physical Hazards / How to Be Safe&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be smart about lifting heavy objects!
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you can’t lift it yourself, ask someone to help.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are lifting something onto a cart, bring the cart close to the object you are moving.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The less carrying, the less strain on your back. As always, lift with your knees and legs, not your back.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always confirm that lighting or audio equipment is off before plugging or unplugging anything.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When using a blade, always cut away from yourself and others; be careful and use common sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wear gloves and long sleeves when planning to touch hot lighting fixtures.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always wear shoes while on the stage. The stage floor splinters terribly and nobody wants that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;closing-the-hall&quot;&gt;Closing the Hall&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When closing the hall, don’t ask if you can clock out or go home until:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is back in its place&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stage/backstage/FOH are totally clean&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everything is setup for the next event&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;All the systems are shut down and the three sets of exterior doors (as well as auxiliary doors to the storage closet, instrument storage, and green room) are closed and locked securely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;door-stops&quot;&gt;Door Stops:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always push door stops into the vestibules, not out into the hallways! This is exactly how they grow legs and walk away (/ get stolen by… other departments). Also, push them to the sides of the vestibules so other people walking in don’t trip over them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;piano-safety&quot;&gt;Piano Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Steinway is a big object on little wheels!
Move it slowly and be aware of all hazards AT ALL TIMES.
Do not allow it to come close to running into doors, door frames and walls or over items such as cables, curtain, or the little metal thresholds for the door closers.
Immediately lock it down after moving it by twisting the pins on the two wheels near the piano keys clockwise until tight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After you have locked down the piano, tri-fold the cover lengthwise, and then roll it up and store it backstage.
Next, lift the cover off the piano keys.
Then, slide the built in music stand toward the keys and lift it up into place.
Ask the the pianist whether they would like the piano lid to be down, at half-stick, or at full-stick.
Always double check that the wheels are locked before lifting the lid.
The full stick sits in the square hole. The half stick sits in the circular hole.
Be extremely careful when handling the piano.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always have at least two people moving the piano; a third is helpful to open doors and move anything that’s in the way.
These two people moving the piano, or at least one of them, should be from our team.
If you see a group trying to move a piano on their own, please step in and put your hands on that piano until it is in place, the wheels are locked, and everyone has stepped away.
Kindly open the lid for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;stage-and-spiking-things&quot;&gt;Stage and Spiking Things&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember to lock the stage wall panels.
If they need to be open at an angle where they cannot lock, sandbag them.
Sandbags can be found in the amp room. If you see bags sitting out, put them back in the amp room.
Confirm that the panels are locked by pushing them gently once or twice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again, double and triple check your work, if necessary, to avoid messing up an entire show. Take your time, ask questions, do it right the first time and you won’t have to be embarrassed when it fails or waste everyone’s time while doing it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Typically, spike the upstage offstage corners of objects.
Spike the piano with L’s on the upstage and offstage sides of the legs.
Spike music stands with T’s directly under the vertical of the stand. Have the long line of the T point the direction the stand faces. If you have more than one stage change, color code each setup. You can even write a note to yourself on the spike tape. Use sharpie or pen and keep it simple. If there is going to be a lot of movement/big set changes, it is a good idea to draw up a stage plot of each change and label the page with the appropriate color of spike tape. If marley is down, put a piece of clear tape over each spike to make sure it doesn’t get danced off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;know-your-stage-directions&quot;&gt;Know Your Stage Directions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stage Left and Stage Right&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When speaking stage directions, you always refer to it from the artist’s perspective. If you are standing on stage, facing the audience, your left is stage left and right is stage right. If you are standing in the audience, or at FOH, and you are calling out stage movement, your left will become “stage right” and your right is “stage left”. Same rule applies to someone standing backstage left and looking onto stage from the wing; away from you should be referred to as “stage right”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On and Off Stage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, if you’re standing at a funny angle, up in the genie, or it doesn’t matter which direction you’re going, it may be easier for you to explain yourself using “on stage” and “off stage.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Off stage” is always referring to the direction further away from the center line of the stage and towards the wings in either direction.
Moving something “on stage” would mean to move it toward the center line from the wings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upstage and Downstage&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upstage is on the stage further away from the audience, so towards the ‘back’ of the stage.
Downstage is further towards the audience, so towards the ‘front’ of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flying in and out&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is how we refer to things that are moving up and down. Battens and banners fly in when they are moving down from the ceiling and they fly out when moving back up toward the ceiling. Always call out, in your loudest speaking voice, to the whole room when you are flying battens in or out. Example: Batten 2 flying out! Or U6 flying in! The response should be: Thank you flying in! or Thank you U6!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Stagehand Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stagehand-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assistance with costume changes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other duties include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Helping other crew members with their set-ups.
Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Before the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a program and take notes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Don’t pay attention to your phone!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;During your scene changes:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Move quickly and with purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###After the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike and clean.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we’re not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Stage Terminology</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-terminology/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-terminology</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Apron: The portion of the stage that is downstage of the proscenium arch. (Since we don’t have a built in proscenium in the hall, we consider the apron to be everything downstage of the ‘plaster line’.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Batten: Part of a fly system. A horizontal pipe, supported by lift lines, electrical hoists (ours are drum winch) &amp;amp; motors (variable speed), which is easily raised and lowered; even while holding a substantial amount of weight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Blackout: Removing all light from the stage, often for a set change.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Boom: A boom is a vertical pipe standing anywhere onstage where lighting units are hung on stage, usually in the wings. They are usually screwed into 50lb boom bases.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Catwalks: A catwalk is a section of the house hidden in the ceiling from which many of the technical functions of a theatre, such as lighting and sound, may be manipulated.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Center Line: A special type of line drawn on a Ground Plan, located at the plane which bisects the stage left and stage right sides of the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Crossover: The upstage place behind any stage curtains or scenery, which allows performers to get from one side of the stage to the other without being seen by the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Cue: Any moment in the course of a performance where there is a change in the physical state. In the case of sound, a cue might start music playing, and then a subsequent cue might lower the volume as an actor starts to speak, and yet another might fade the music to silence when the scene comes to an end. Cues are most often associated with lighting and sound (any given show quite often has hundreds of light and sound cues), but cues are also established when scenery needs to change, line sets need to fly, effects need to be triggered, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Dimmer room: The room which contains the dimmer racks which power the lighting rig in the theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Electric: An electric is a horizontal pipe hanging upstage of the proscenium (usually part of the fly system), often with lighting circuits connected to it, where lighting units are hung in a theater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Fly System: A series of pulleys, ropes, wires, and/or other apparatus which collectively allows the hanging and vertical movement of curtains, lighting instruments, scenery, and even people. (Our fly system is motorized electrical drum winch hoists and controlled through the automated rigging system.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Grand Curtain (or Main Curtain): The curtain that closes just upstage of the proscenium arch. Generally speaking, opening the grand curtain signifies the start of the show or act and closing it signifies the end of the act or show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;House: The place where the audience sits to watch the performance. Also the place where lighting instruments hang when they’re hanging over the audience. Front-of-House can refer to the lobby or other non-performance space where audience members congregate before and after the show and during intermission. (Just to confuse things, Audio Engineers also refer to front-of-house, or FOH, as their house mix position in order to differentiate themselves from the the monitor engineer on stage.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Masking: As a noun, anything which hides something from the audience. As a verb, the act of hiding things from the audience.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plaster Line: An imaginary reference line on stage that indicates where the proscenium arch is. (Our plaster line runs stage left to right from about the point where the stage starts to curve on the downstage lip.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Proscenium Arch: The viewing portal or frame through which the audience sees the performance. (Our Proscenium Arch is theoretical except for when the grand curtain and border are hanging on U1 and U2.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Shell: A hard, often movable surface, designed to reflect sound into the audience for musical performances.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sight lines: Imaginary lines indicating the view from the extreme-most seats. If someone or something is said to be in sight lines, it means that they are visible to all audience members regardless of seating choice. If someone or something is described as out of sightlines, it means that no audience members are able to see them. A good rule of thumb for sightlines is “if you can see them, they can see you.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Soft Goods: Curtains that are used onstage. This can include the “Blacks,” “Cyc,” “Grand Curtain,” and “Scrims,” among other things.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spike: Marking the stage floor with an indicator showing the location of a set piece or where a performer should stand. Spike marks are usually made on the upstage corners of a prop with small pieces of spike tape to show the direction it should be facing and also color coded by set transition.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stage/Deck: The primary playing space surrounded by the apron, wings, and fly space.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Strike: Strike can be referred to as temporarily taking something away (e.g. “During the scene change, you strike the phone.”).  It can also be used at the end of a run to specify that everything should be disassembled, put away and cleaned in order to have a fresh canvas for the next group coming in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Trim: The height that a batten or any other object hangs at.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Wings: Areas that are part of a stage deck but offstage (out of sight of the audience). The wings are typically masked with legs. The wing space is used for performers preparing to enter, storage of sets for scenery changes and as a stagehand work area. Wings also contain technical equipment, such as the fly system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Stage Manager Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-manager-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/stage-manager-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Out of all the members of the crew on the show call, congratulations, you have the most duties. You are the liaison between the crew and the performers. All stage management duties follow a logic of making a show run smoothly. Communicate with your crew and the visiting production team and you will be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###Before the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, go up to Erin’s office and get the stage management keys. Keep them on you for the rest of the night. Don’t forget to return them at the end of the night.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the space, propping open backstage doors and the green room.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unlock the backstage cabinet.  Make sure it stays closed throughout the day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on Scene Control, the stage manager console, and the amp room sequencer (plus sub amp).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on your backstage monitor at the stage manager console. Make sure that there are no banners in the way and that the camera is in focus so you can see the stage. If you can’t see anything on your monitor, check in with your supervisor or other crew members. They can help you fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the board operators and visiting production team. While the board ops are in charge of discussing their specific needs, you should have a general grasp of what is happening on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find out if the group has any digital materials. While digital files for projection or audio playback should be handed over to your board ops, digital signage for the lobby LCD screens will be inserted by you at the Stage Manager console. (More on this later)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Alternately, you can send the live camera feed to the lobby monitors after rehearsals are finished, once the stage has cleared and house is open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get a copy of the program. If there is none, speak with someone from the team and build one out. Take notes on entrances, exits, and cues (both light and sound). Some groups will provide their own cue sheet. Determine the entire show flow:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time is the show supposed to start?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;What time should the doors open to the public?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Is there an intermission? If so, for how long?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When is the show scheduled to end?&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Who will be walking onto stage, when and from where? Do they need mics?&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up your clearcom backstage. Your headset, pack, and cable are in the drawer in the stage management console. Spares are in the upstage right cabinet.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Do a clearcom check with your board operators. Have them go on headset. Check if you can hear one another, your volumes are set properly and your call buttons work.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During Doors&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Right after doors are open, put the DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR sign on the back of the downstage left door. From this point on, YOU are the only person allowed to open this door. DO NOT let anyone (even Bill or Obama) run past you onto stage without clearing it with lighting and sound first. FOH relies on you heavily to start the show only after they are ready. Own this door, it’s yours.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk over to the green room and inform performers that the house is now open.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Five minutes prior to show, give a 5 minute warning to members of the cast and crew. If performers request more time, let your house staff know if they need to hold doors or if the show will start late.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Collect your first performers backstage. Keep them backstage and ready to start.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the show is ready to start, tell your friends at FOH to begin the process of house lights to half. This will notify the audience to take their seats and prepare for the start of the show. Allow one minute for everyone to get settled and then request the lighting operator to bring the house lights all the way out and into the first lighting look - usually stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wait for confirmation that the light change is in progress and send out your performers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the performers are out, close the inner vestibule doors as to isolate sound from the hall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###During the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.  Cross out movements/acts as they finish to stay on track.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Watch the backstage left monitor for stage movement. Be ready and open the door if someone is walking offstage.  Make sure you actually open the door before they get close to it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If handing out wireless microphones, remember to check that they are on/have full battery strength before handing them out. Confirm with your sound board op as to which mic you’ve given out. Make sure you get the mic back when the person exits stage, turn it off if it won’t be in use again.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are nervous the person using the mic will accidentally turn it off during their performance, or if the sound board operator has requested it, put a sleeve on the microphone.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help nervous actors, musicians and other talent by being a calming force. Exude confidence.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You are the backstage point person throughout the entire show, help talent with anything they need - water, towel, safety pin, costume change, even a bucket to puke in (use a lined garbage can).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###After the Show&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Return your ClearCom &amp;amp; cable to its drawer.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help others strike what needs to be struck.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make the hall usable for the next day’s crew. For example, if you used the piano but the next crew will not, return it to instrument storage. If you didn’t use the piano but they will, bring it out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clean up and throw away any garbage or show specific paperwork. Empty the trash bin backstage.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Try to return any personal items left behind.  If the group is long gone, leave these items with the lost and found at the North Desk and tell the building manager on duty.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everyone has cleared out, make sure all 3 entrances are closed and locked, as well as the green room entrances, storage closets, and stage door.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you turned on scene control, turn it off and reconnect its key with the stage manager key set.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IMPORTANT&lt;/strong&gt;: DO NOT FORGET to return the stage manager key set to Erin’s office. The next morning’s crew will not be able to do anything without this key set and will have to hunt you down. Public shaming will ensue.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, logistical mishaps, or mischievous deviants, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report instead if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Penthouse Lightboard Cheatsheet</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/penthouse-lightboard-cheatsheet/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/penthouse-lightboard-cheatsheet</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;###Startup&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn on board via power switch under front lip of board&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure all cables are plugged in first.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Board will take a while to start up&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the top bank of sliders (they are labeled on the board) to create different lighting looks in the room and shift between them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###If you want to bring up specific lights, refer to the “magic sheet” image further down this page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Type in the number corresponding to the lights you want to bring up on the number pad.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then hit [@] and a value from 0-100 and then [Enter] to set their brightness.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hit the [Undo] key several times to turn them off and release control of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###To shut the board down&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Move the mouse to the top of the screen so the menu bar appears, click on the File menu and then Click Exit.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Then click the power button in the lower left corner of the screen, to the right of where it says “Run Palette.”&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The board will then (slowly) shut down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;###If the Board Crashes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can hard power down the board by holding down the power button.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Only do this if you absolutely need to!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Lighting Board Operator Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/lighting-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/lighting-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;before-the-show&quot;&gt;Before the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take notes on lighting cues needed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure &lt;strong&gt;EP LOCKOUT&lt;/strong&gt; is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-show&quot;&gt;During the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Follow along with the program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.
Communicate with the stage manager.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;after-the-show&quot;&gt;After the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>General Duties</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/general-duties/"/>
   <updated>2016-08-28T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/08/28/general-duties</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Always check the &lt;strong&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/strong&gt; to see what company you’ll be working with for your shift. If you’re lucky, the visiting artists have been responsive, thought ahead, and had the foresight to fully plan out their performance details.  If so, a basic rundown of what needs to be done will be in the calendar notes section. Make a mental note of these tasks and be prepared to accomplish all. Ask questions ahead of time if you have any, such as “Do we need to check out any gear from the cage?” or “What time is the talent arriving?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clocking in and out&lt;/strong&gt; is important; don’t mess this part up or HR will start to dislike you as a person. They are the ones that write your checks, so seriously, don’t mess this part up. It’s your responsibility to remember to do this. If for some reason you forgot to clock in or out at the right time, immediately send an email to Erin detailing the time/date that you did clock in/out vs the time/date that you were supposed to clock in/out.  Words like “today”, “yesterday” and “last Monday” don’t cut it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As stated in the &lt;a href=&quot;/2016/04/12/stagehand-guide.html&quot;&gt;Stagehand Guide&lt;/a&gt;, you should dress appropriately to each crew call.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as an event on the &lt;strong&gt;Performance&lt;/strong&gt; calendar, do not fail to dress the part.  If you are normally backstage, you must wear black head to toe. If you know you will be sitting at front of house, you can either wear all blacks or professional clothing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your shift is scheduled at the same time as something on the &lt;strong&gt;Rehearsal&lt;/strong&gt; calendar, feel free to relax those standards a bit.  If nothing else is scheduled coinciding with your shift, you can expect tech work and should wear more comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you complete your tasks quickly and see others still working, go lend them a hand. This is not a union house–you can cross between departments. Whoever you may be, meet up with the rest of the crew or the members of a visiting production team. Understand what is expected of you throughout the show.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;during-the-show&quot;&gt;During the Show&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you do not have anything to do for a while, do not busy yourself with homework, reading, or facebook. Your actions distract audience members and artists while you end up looking lazy to the other professionals. Watch and pay attention to the show. You never know what is going to happen on stage and if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss your cue. If you cannot spare four or six hours to work a show, then you should not take the shift.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Be extra quiet while a performance is taking place.  The hall was designed with acoustics in mind. Someone speaking at a normal volume on stage can be heard throughout the entire room.  Remember this when talking through clear com at the FOH position, especially during quieter parts of the show. With a headset on, what might seem like a whisper to you can be heard by everyone around you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for any reason you need to walk away from your post for a moment, let the rest of the crew know by saying, “[your name] going off headset.” Give the other crew members a second to respond in case they have something important to say before you go. When you return, let them know you’re back on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Always, &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; act professionally. Your actions reflect the entire crew, your bosses, the venue and building.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Video Rack Guide</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/video/video-rack-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/video-rack-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;Intro&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video rack is a bit of a beast of a rig. Don’t be frightened by it.
There are a lot of wires and components on the inside of it, but most of the actual signal flow is relatively simple. In this tutorial we’ll break down the sections of it that you need to know, and explain how the signals flow into, out of and within the rack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;major-sections&quot;&gt;Major Sections&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mac Pro
Multiview
Converters
IO Panel
USB Hub&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;io-panel&quot;&gt;IO Panel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is where all the signals come into and out of the rack. As such, if you need to troubleshoot anything, this is the place to start. In an ideal world, you shouldn’t change anything further down the signal chain than the IO Panel. If changing things here doesn’t resolve your issues, think long and hard before you go changing any connections beyond this point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;io-panel-connections&quot;&gt;IO Panel Connections&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SWITCHED:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the switched power that feeds the Furman relay. It is switched via the switch on the front of the Furman, and feeds power to a number of the video converters.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;UNSWITCHED:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This power connection feeds :&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Creston:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the Crestron Fiber optic connection&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FW32&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;NETWORK&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;NETWORK&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;USB&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;PROJECTOR:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the DVI feed out to the Projector. The cable travels along the trough under FOH and comes up in Projection Boot and plugs into one of the DVI ports on the bottom of front panel of the left most rack by the projectors.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STAGE IN SDI
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is fed from V37 and is used to route a signal from somewhere on stage up to the KUMO&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;STAGE OUT SDI
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This feeds V38 and is used to route a signal from one of the KUMO inputs to a display feed somewhere other than FOH, usually for confidence monitors or projectors on stage.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;AMX MON

    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;BLANK SDI&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;FOH IN
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is where the FOH HDMI cable patches into the video rack. From here it connects to the FOH HDMI AJA Converter and from there into the Decimator Multiview and on to the KUMO.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MULTIVIEW
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the HDMI feed that comes from the Multiview and goes to the Right hand Display on the FOH desk.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DISPLAY (?)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CRESTRON
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;This is the HDMI port that feeds the HDMI input on the Crestron panel on the ABP under the FOH Desk.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;making-sense-of-it-all&quot;&gt;Making Sense of it All&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The biggest thing that will help you to understand how the video rack works is to have an understanding of the underlying signal flow. If you can understand how the signals move around and are altered in an abstract fashion, making sense of the cable mess becomes, if not easier, then a little more straightforward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The video signals that run into, out of and around the video rack come in two ‘flavors’, SDI (specifically &lt;strong&gt;__&lt;/strong&gt;__) and HDMI. Any time you need to make a change between the two formats, you need a converter. The converters in the rack take the form of the small grey AJA boxes. These AJA boxes accomplish the same function as the larger, bright red Decimator boxes that you may have seen around before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, why exactly are we converting between SDI and HDMI in the first place? Why can’t we just use one format? The answer to those questions has to do with the nature of the Hardware we use for various purposes in the hall. HDMI can be thought of as more of a consumer level format. You use it to connect your laptop or computer to a monitor or TV or a small projector. SDI on the other hand, is a format used in higher profile professional hardware, such as the NEC Projector (the one in the projection booth), video switching hardware like the AJA KUMO, and for transporting video signals over distances longer than a couple feet without signal degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we often deal with multiple video signals that we like to be able to switch between for displaying various media during shows, we use specialized hardware to be able to switch between all of our signals. For us, this hardware is the AJA KUMO 1604, which has 16 SDI inputs and 4 SDI outputs. The KUMO can route any of the 16 inputs to any of the 4 outputs and can switch back and forth relatively seamlessly, with control being accessed via a network connection than you can call up in a browser (See the ‘KUMO’ bookmark in Chrome on the FOH Mac Pro).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if we have an HDMI signal on a laptop at FOH that we want to be able to route to a display on stage, one way to do this would be to just hook the HDMI up to a Decimator, take the SDI output, patch it to the ABP and do the opposite on stage. However if we want to be able to switch the signal that the display receives, we would want to hook the HDMI upto an HDMI to SDI converter (like the Decimator or the AJA boxes), and run the SDI into the AJA, so that we can switch the display’s feed back and forth between this HDMI and the other signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;multiview&quot;&gt;Multiview&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we’ve covered why we need to convert signals and how the KUMO accomplishes the signal switching we like to be able to do, but one thing we’ve yet to discuss is the Multiview and how that fits into the signal chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we’re switching back and forth between the various video feeds we have to deal with during a show, it’s convenient if not necessary to be able to see what each signal is to ensure that we’re not going to go live on a blank screen or some other unsuitable feed. The Multiview allows us to quickly inspect a lot of different signals quickly to make sure everything is how it should be. However in order to do this, it needs all the signals we worry about to flow through it. This makes our lives a little more difficult in terms of troubleshooting things, and certainly makes the video rack a lot messier, but provides necessary functionality that outweighs these costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to revisit our previous example, we have an HDMI signal we want to be able to get from a laptop at FOH down to a display or projector on the stage. We patch into the FOH HDMI cable that sits at the desk. That cable goes into the IO Panel on the back of the video rack. From there an HDMI cable runs inside the rack to an AJA HDMI to SDI converter. The SDI cable that comes out of that carrying our signal goes into an input on the multiview and comes out unchanged on a loop output from the multiview. From the multiview the new SDI cable patches to an input on the back of the AJA KUMO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An important part of this is that the signal the Multiview is getting and showing us from the FOH HDMI is the same as the signal it then sends to the input on the KUMO. The multiview lets us look at a number of the signals we’re getting on the ‘Preview Monitor’, so that we can know what we’re getting before we switch our signals with the KUMO.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic&quot;&gt;BASIC&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;SOURCE = MacMini or FOH HDMI&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Turn the Switcher Rack On (Black on / off flip switch, right side)&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;On the AMX Touch interface, hit “Turn on system and projector”&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Open Chrome on the Mac Mini and Open the Kumo Bookmark&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Click Projector on the Bottom Row&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Select your source on the Top Row&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Hs68lLj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image One&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;if-that-doesnt-get-you-an-image-now-we-start&quot;&gt;If that doesn’t get you an image now we start:&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt; &lt;em&gt;TROUBLESHOOTING&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you are actually sending some sort of image from your source: (very helpful to have the preview monitor at FOH set to the same source as the projector)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your source is the mac mini, try dragging a window to the right&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you’re using a different source, make sure your display preferences are set up correctly&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the lamp of the projector is actually on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;In Chrome, open the &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; bookmark. On the top left side there will be a little button that says Lamp and it will have on and off buttons on either side of the label. Make sure “ON” is selected.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the image is not muted&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/xncCve2.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Two&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;intermediate&quot;&gt;INTERMEDIATE&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;source--stage&quot;&gt;SOURCE = STAGE&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER YOU HAVE ALREADY DONE THE &lt;strong&gt;BASIC&lt;/strong&gt; INSTRUCTIONS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get the Decimator, its power adaptor, and one of the long Blue SDI Cables* from Janice [When using the SDI cables, be gentle with them, be careful not to kink them, and please coil them properly when striking] . You may also need an extension cord and / or a power strip.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get whatever adaptors / other cables you need to be able send an HDMI signal to the Decimator from your source. (Probably a Thunderbolt to HDMI, or DVI to HDMI)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect one end of the Blue SDI Cable to the SDI OUTPUT on the Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the other end of the SDI Cable to one of the AVP Patch Points (If Downstage Right, use AV12, and run the cable up over the doorway.)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect your source HDMI cable to the Decimator’s HDMI INPUT&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Confirm that your AVP Patch point (the one to which you connected the Blue SDI cable) is patched to AV38 in the patchbay (The default patching is AV12 to AV38)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the KUMO Routing Interface (Chrome), select Projector on the Bottom Row and STAGE on the Top Row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get you an image. If it doesn’t, refer to the &lt;a href=&quot;#troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/a&gt; section above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, if none of that works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check Your SDI Patching.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the Decimator is on (the screen will be lit).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the BNC Patching in the Patchbay&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure AV38 at FOH is actually connected to something, it should be SDI input #3 on the back of the AJA in the rack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing--sizing-the-image-basic-without-presets&quot;&gt;REFOCUSING / SIZING THE IMAGE (Basic/ Without Presets)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the projector is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the projector interface on chrome&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the “Basic Control” tab on the left&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use the sets of arrows to adjust the image according to what you need&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For this you only have coarse adjust:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;When you click an arrow it will continue to adjust in that direction until you click the square in the center of the arrows&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Also, when focusing, try and have someone on stage close to the screen (or whatever you’re projecting onto) to confirm the focusing&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/5Jrk0p3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Three&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;refocusing--sizing-intermediate--with-presets&quot;&gt;REFOCUSING / SIZING (Intermediate / With Presets)&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can do all the same things you can do from the web interface, and more, from the projection booth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go into the projection booth&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the computer is on
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The computer is in the left rack, underneath the HDCam players, and underneath the screen that pulls out&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It’s a 1U rack unit with a disk drive on the left and a “SuperLogics” logo, there is a red power button on the right.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Push the power button and the fan will start up, letting you know that it’s on.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull out the screen drawer (the black handle on the rack unit above the computer)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click the &lt;strong&gt;DCCs2&lt;/strong&gt; icon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In the communication settings window, make sure &lt;strong&gt;Projector&lt;/strong&gt; is selected&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The IP Address is:  &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;192.168.1.134&lt;/code&gt; Port is: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;43728&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hx6h4VI.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Four&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Click OK (Also, the projector must be on in order to communicate with it. If it’s not on, nothing further will work. &lt;em&gt;And how were you planning to size an image if it’s off anyways?&lt;/em&gt; :P&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/O1bGrL9.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image Five&quot; /&gt;
7. Once the communication loading bar has completed and gone away, click the &lt;strong&gt;lens&lt;/strong&gt; tab at the top.
8. From the lens tab you have access to the focusing and resizing adjustments, as well as Fine Adjust mode, and &lt;em&gt;presets&lt;/em&gt;
	* SAVING A PRESET&lt;/p&gt;

 		* Make all the image adjustments you need
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Memory List&lt;/strong&gt; button to access the list of presets, then click a new row under all the ones that currently exist
 		* Click &lt;strong&gt;Entry&lt;/strong&gt;, and name your preset, once it’s named you’re all good
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;LOADING A PRESET&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

 		* Select the preset you want to load
 		* Click the &lt;strong&gt;Test&lt;/strong&gt; button, and the preset will begin to load

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;confidence-monitors&quot;&gt;CONFIDENCE MONITORS&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using the Confidence Monitors is sort of the opposite of running a source from the stage in terms of signal flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Get out the Confidence Monitor rack case from Janice, grab one of the blue SDI cables, and get as many monitors and heavy duty DVI cables as you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set up the case where it will live during the show, it needs power and needs to be relatively close to both an AVP, and the monitors to which you will be running the DVI cables.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the power cord for the rack supply, and turn the rack on. There should be blue and green lights that indicate that the unit is on.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the blue SDI cable to one of the AV patch points on the AVP&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the patching in the patchbay is set up properly so that the AV patch point where you connected the SDI cable is hooked up to the point from where the signal at FOH is sending.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the DVI cables from the back of the inside of the confidence monitor rack to the monitors you will be using, making sure to run the cable out of the way and to be gentle with the cable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Video Overflow Setup</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/video/overflow-video-streams.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/video/overflow-video-streams</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;setting-up-mezzanine-and-lobby-overflow-video-streams&quot;&gt;Setting up Mezzanine and Lobby Overflow Video Streams&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;equipment&quot;&gt;Equipment&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To set up a video feed for the Gidwitz Lobby Displays and the Mezzanine,
you will need the following equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(2) Decimator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(3) SDI Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(2) XLR Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(3) HDMI Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) XLR-&amp;gt;RCA Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) 1/4”-&amp;gt;XLR Cable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Haivision Encoder (stays in the Amp rack)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Haivision Decoder (borrowed from another space)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(1) Long (25ft or more) Ethernet Cable (will need to be checked out from the cage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(n) Large Portable TV (located on the 11th floor, will need to be checked out from the cage)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;(n) Hai-vision Decoder Remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;foh-setup&quot;&gt;FOH Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is an external videographer, skip this section. If there is no videographer, we will need to use equipment from the cage.
Check out a video camera and a tripod and set them up next to the FOH desk. We recommend the Sony PMW-EX1R HD Video Camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up an audio feed for the videographer’s camera on the Venue with an AUX patched to an unused output(x).
This aux should include all live mics and digital audio channels.
Connect AUX-out(x) to the camera’s XLR-in and make sure the audio is routed to SDI-out on the camera.
Using the SDI cable, patch the camera into V40 at the FOH AVP under the desk.
Set up another AUX on the Venue (should be a copy of the first) so that it is patched to another unused output (y).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;amp-room-setup&quot;&gt;Amp Room Setup&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect power to the Decimator.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patch V40 video output into Decimator SDI input using an SDI patch cable (these can be found on the wall and have a tube connection on one end and an SDI connection on the other).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the Decimator’s HDMI-out to the Haivision Encoder’s HDMI-&amp;gt;DVI-in adapter using a short HDMI cable.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The encoder is located in the open slot in the rightmost rack towards the top, labeled ‘Performance Hall’. You can place the Decimator in this slot next to the encoders.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;To run the cable you will have to feed it through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take output (y) you patched at the Venue from ‘Venue Outputs’ (center column in the amp room; APB-07; red and white labels) with ¼”-&amp;gt;XLR cable, connect it to the XLR-&amp;gt;RCA cable, and plug the RCA-outs into the RCA-ins at the back of the  encoder.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Again, feed the cable through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run SDI from the Decimator’s SDI-out to SM console.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&amp;lt;-SDI-in, SDI-out(1)&amp;lt;-SDI-in (make loop)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;stage-manager-console-setup&quot;&gt;Stage Manager Console Setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Set up a second Decimator with SDI-in taken from the Amp Room SDI run (on the floor, a shelf, or table is fine as long as the cables aren’t a trip hazard).
Connect power to the Decimator, and send HDMI-out to Crestron panel’s HDMI-in using the second HDMI cable. Enter Technician Mode at Crestron panel (5540) and route “SM Input” to Lower Lobby, Auditorium, Theater East, and Theater West for overflow viewing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&amp;lt;-SDI-in&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;theater-eastwest&quot;&gt;Theater East/West&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carefully remove the Decoder box from below the TV in either Theater West or Theater East. Make sure the disconnected cables are stable and accessible for reconnection during strike.
(When restoring these, take care with cable/port matches: Yellow Component cable -&amp;gt; Yellow Component output, Black/Silver Audio cable -&amp;gt; Red audio output)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;mezzanine&quot;&gt;Mezzanine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect the ethernet cable to left port (the right port is disconnected) of ethernet #243 (located in the office to the right when you walk in) and connect the other end to “Primary” on the Decoder box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug in power for the TV, and plug the DC-Adapter into an outlet and connect it to the Decoder box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run Component-outs from the Decoder to Component-ins on back of TV.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn on TV and set to Component source.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run HDMI-out from the Decoder to HDMI-in on back of TV using the third HDMI cable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The following must be done quickly using the decoder remote:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;select 1080i-out on Decoder&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;switch TV source to HDMI&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;hit accept/confirm on Decoder remote&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

   <title>A Guide to Laying and Striking Marley</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/marley-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/marley-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Marley is a type of dance floor. It allows dancers to move easily across the deck and offers more give, resulting in higher and more efficient jumps. Marley comes in heavy vinyl strips. These strips are about four feet wide and span the length of the stage. To both lay out and strike marley, you need at least two people. Ideally, you have a crew of four: two to tape down a strip while the other two prep the next strips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall’s marley is stored on pieces of white PVC pipe backstage right. When the flooring is down, the empty rolls can live backstage left, preferably upstage and out of the way. To lay the marley you’ll start offstage right. When rolling it back up you’ll start offstage left. The bottom of the marley will be on the outside of the roll; make sure the correct side is face up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before marley is laid out, the stage should be swept thoroughly. The Performance Hall’s marley is cut into seven panels (1 = upstage, 7 = downstage apron). Each is labeled. If for some reason you can’t find the label, relabel it using gaff tape and a sharpie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To lay a marley floor you will need: marley tape, scissors/a blade, at least one buddy, knee pads (optional). While Marley tape is black like gaff tape, it is smooth and shiny in texture. Do not use gaff tape on the marley; it will leave behind a residue. When you need to cut marley tape, use scissors or a blade. Don’t try to tear the marley tape, it’s not worth the effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For both laying and striking the marley, the wings stage left and right should be open. The marley will lie underneath them. Be careful when sliding the marley under each panel; go too far and you’ll hit a hinge and need to readjust. Try not to cover any of the panel locking drop holes so you can still lock them into place if needed. Be aware that the Performance Hall’s stage is trapezoidal. The upstage wall is shorter than the downstage edge and the marley is cut to match this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;laying-marley&quot;&gt;Laying Marley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;beginning-the-process&quot;&gt;Beginning the process:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With another person, move the roll #6 of marley to the stage right, downstage corner. The rolls are very heavy, so be careful and work in a team when possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The best way to move the marley is to slowly walk the roll over on its end.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tip the marley onto the floor so the longer edge is downstage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove the pieces of tape holding the roll together. If any tape goo is left on the marley, clean it before laying it down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Unroll the marley fully by pushing the roll across the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Store the PVC pipes in the backstage left corner, upstage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;With another person, align the edges of the marley with off stage walls. Once it’s even on both sides and kissing the lip, park it and tape it down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are no bubbles, tape the stage left and right sides down first. Use three pieces of tape running off stage (one upstage, one downstage and one center) to anchor both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there are bubbles, tape one side down and have one person kneel on that edge to hold it in place. Have a second person on the other edge pulling toward themselves and a third person stomp across toward the second person. Once the third person has crossed the stage, the second person will tape their edge down before the third person steps off the marley.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;taping-lengthwise&quot;&gt;Taping lengthwise:&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Start offstage right and work your way stage left as a team (or vice versa).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech A will hold the tape down while the Tech B creates a long stretch of slack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Before touching the tape down, Tech B will stretch it taut and carefully hold it over the seam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Tech A will then smoothly press the tape onto the ground (moving toward Tech B) and check for any irregularity along the way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Continue this process across the length of the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While Techs A and B are taping Panel 6, Techs C and D should be prepping the next panel, laying the rest of the panels out in order.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When securing section #7, tape slowly and try to follow the curve of the lip smoothly. If you must fold tape over the stage edge, do so, but do it neatly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If for some reason you have irregularity, fix the issue before moving on. Irregularity can create dangerous situations for dancers who are unaware of the problem. Here are some situations you would fix:
* If the marley is overlapping under the tape, either press it out or lift up and start again. A small gap between panels is better than overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If there is a bubble in the marley itself, stomp it out in the direction you’re taping.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If your roll runs out of tape, cut that edge straight, tape it down and grab a new roll. Line up the new piece of tape carefully to ensure clean overlap.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You just laid your own dance floor!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Only one more thing to do before you take a break: dry sweep and mop the marley flooring. Use a bit of the Roscoe Marley Floor Cleaner in your bucket of water but nothing else. If an outside stage manager wants to use something else, ask your supervisor first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;notes&quot;&gt;Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before every rehearsal or performance on marley, the stage must be swept and then mopped. Mop in smooth figure eights across the stage pulling the dirt toward you and not pushing it out away from you. Clean one strip at a time. When you’ve pulled all the dirt to one end of the stage, use the mop to pick up the dirt and deposit it into the water bucket. Do not walk on the marley until it is dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using marley alongside soft goods, always roll marley out first. When you need to sweep and mop the marley while soft goods are in, fly the goods out about a foot. This will allow you to clean the entire floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;striking-the-marley&quot;&gt;Striking the Marley&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Striking marley is far easier than laying it. If there are soft goods hanging that touch the floor, sweep the stage and strike the soft goods first. Then:
*Sweep and mop one last time. Wait for the marley to dry. DO NOT roll the marley up if it is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remove all of your tape. (Make a giant tape ball, if you’d like! Play with it, name it, take it home, and shower it with unconditional love. Don’t shower with it.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Collect your PVC pipes. Always roll panels stage left to stage right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Starting downstage left (Strip #7), tape the edge of the marley to your PVC pipe at three points; top, center and bottom (Strips #7 and #6 have unique edges that will only need one or two strips of tape to anchor them to the PVC pipe).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure you are taping the marley to the pipe in a way that will allow you to roll the marley in a straight line the entire length of the floor.  One side should always be flush with the pipe edge but not overextending over the end of the pipe edge.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If you find that you have lost sight of the pipe on your straight edge, unroll and start over.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you get to the end, make sure you still have the one exposed PVC pipe edge you’ve been working hard to maintain throughout the length of the roll.  This is the side the marley will stand on when stored upright.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If it looks good and your edge is straight, you’re ready to tape the rolled up marley to itself (again top, center, and bottom).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Double check that it has not lost its label. If it has, make a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Stand the rolled up marley in its home backstage right.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;DO NOT store upright unsupported by the PVC pipe with the weight on the edge of the flooring itself. This will cause the ends to bend and crease in ways that will damage the marley long term.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Grand Tutorial</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/stage/grand-curtain-guide.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/stage/grand-curtain-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-the-grand-is&quot;&gt;What the Grand Is&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our Grand Curtain is a manually operated dual curtain system used to cut the
stage (usually very far downstage) in order to create dramatic opening and
finale effects.
It consists of:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) batton mounted frames, one upstage, one downstage, which support three of the four pulleys,
 and support the track on which the curtain carriers run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four (4) pulleys, three of which reside on the frame pieces, and one of which lives on the ground during operation of the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Fifty-six (56) single curtain carriers. One single curtain carrier lives at the offstage end of each frame piece, closest to the pulley.
The remaining 54 single carriers are evenly distributed on the tracks of each of the frame pieces, and support and enable the movement of the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Single Carrier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) master curtain carriers. One master carrier lives on each track as the furthest on-stage carrier, after all the single carriers have been placed.
The master carriers serve to clamp the rope to segment it into two pieces, which is essential for the proper operation of the curtain. More on this later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_8.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Master Carrier&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Four (4) end stops. Two of these live towards the offstage ends of the carrier track, and two of these live at the onstage ends of the track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_9.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;End Stop&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;One (1) rope. The rope forms a loop that connects through all the curtain carriers and pulleys and (ideally, if the curtain is set up correctly)
  permits the opening and closing of the Grand Curtain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Two (2) curtains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;how-the-grand-works&quot;&gt;How the Grand Works&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two most important concepts to comprehend in order to understand the operation of the Grand are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The free/restricted movement of the curtain carriers on the track&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The movement of the rope through the pulleys and how this influences the movement of the curtain carriers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-rope&quot;&gt;On the Rope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When set up properly, the rope forms a giant loop that connects through:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The pulley on the floor (from where the curtain is operated)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage stage left vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stage right horizontal pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The pulley on the floor to complete the loop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rope is divided into two segments via clamping at the two master carriers. One of these segments consists of everything that is &lt;strong&gt;stage left&lt;/strong&gt;
of the downstage master carrier that the rope comes in contact with, so:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage single carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The downstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The ground pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage vertical pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope between the upstage vertical pulley and the upstage master carrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other segment consists of everything that is effectively &lt;strong&gt;stage right&lt;/strong&gt; of the downstage master carrier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope between the downstage master carrier and the stage right horizontal pulley&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The stage right horizontal pulley itself&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage single curtain carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The upstage master curtain carrier&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The segmentation / clamping at the master carriers is one of the integral parts of the movement of the curtain.
If not for this, the rope would just move mostly unimpeded through the single carriers and the curtain would not move along with the rope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this importance, it is pertinent to have the proper lengths of rope in each segment,
and the proper amount of slack distributed between the segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When initially setting up the rope, you must size the rope lengths to the stage right segment. The stage left segment is slightly more
flexible in terms of the acceptable range of rope length and permittable slack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-movement-of-the-rope&quot;&gt;The Movement of the Rope&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the rope is clamped at the two master carriers, pulling on one of the two vertical segments of rope from the floor position
either closes or opens the curtain. This works because the rope is fixed at the master carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you imagine a position at upstage center to be 12 o clock, closing the curtain moves the rope and the carriers clockwise around the loop, and opening the curtain moves the
rope/carriers counterclockwise around the loop. The master carriers are hooked to the onstage edges of the curtain. The single carriers are hooked onto the rest of the grommets with the most offstage grommet hooked to a carrier that is secured behind a bracket on the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the curtain is closed and the master carriers are pulled onstage the master carriers will pull the curtain edges taught and cause the single carriers to pseudo-follow the rope as they follow the grommets on the curtain to which they are connected as the curtain is gradually pulled taught. When the curtain is opened the master carriers will be pulled offstage and will collide with the single carriers, pulling them offstage with it. This will pull the curtain along with the grommets similar to the action when closing the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that you hopefully understand the movement of the curtain, let’s tell you how to actually build it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;building-the-curtain&quot;&gt;Building the Curtain&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First gather the parts and tools you’ll need. These include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The single and master curtain carriers
&lt;br /&gt;   These live in a plastic bin in the stage right upstage wing&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The rope - Lives in another plastic bin by the bin for the carriers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Crescent wrenches - Live in Janice on one of the lower-ish shelves&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Patience - Find it inside yourself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fly in U2, assuming the frame for the Grand is still built out on it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;placing-the-curtain-carriers-on-the-track&quot;&gt;Placing the Curtain Carriers on the Track&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to do is remove the end stops from the onstage ends of the track.
You’re doing this in order to place the curtain carriers on the track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the end stops are off, place twenty-seven (27) single carriers on each track.
These need to be placed so that the fold guides are pointing downstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the single carriers are all placed, count them again to make sure you have 27 on each side,
then place one master carrier on each track, these should be oriented so that the metal posts on the downstage
master carriers point downstage, and so that the posts on the upstage master carrier point upstage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the carriers are all in place, check again to make sure you have the proper number of carriers on each track,
then replace and re-secure the end stops at the onstage ends of the tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the end stops are in place you can begin to thread the rope through the pulleys and carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;threading-the-rope&quot;&gt;Threading the Rope&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Begin by threading the rope through the floor pulley. With the pulley placed on the floor and the knob facing stage left and you,
thread the rope through the gap in the top on the right hand side, staying between the pulley and the bar. Continue feeding the rope along
the wheel, staying inside the posts, until you can bring the rope up out the other side of the gap at the top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feed the end of the rope that you pulled through the left side of the gap through the downstage, stage left vertical pulley.
With this pulley, (and with its upstage cousin later on) take the rope up and outside the bottom bar, then feed it along the
wheel and the inside of the posts until you can come out the onstage gap that leads to the curtain carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through that pulley, feed it through the big holes of the downstage single carriers, starting with the one closest to the vertical pulley
(this is stage left of the offstage endstop and may be hard to see, as it’s very close to the pulley). Feed the rope through all the big holes on the single carriers one after the other, making sure not to skip any.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve finished threading the downstage single carriers, skip the downstage master carrier for now, and pull the rope to the stage right horizontal pulley.
Thread through the stage right horizontal pulley. Feed the rope through the inner gap, around the wheel, again, staying on the inside of the bar in the back. However,
once you’re around the back and the rope is along the wheel, skip going back through the inner gap and feed the rope through the offstage single carrier’s hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_11.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Stage Right Pulley&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now feed through the rest of the upstage single carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through all the single carriers, pull the master carrier to the onstage end of the track. Now pull the rope so that you have about a foot and a half of slack at the master carrier at the end of the track. Push the rope into the gap between the metal posts of the master carrier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have someone go to the downstage master carrier and pull it as far onstage as it will go. Have the upstage person
hold their end of the rope, and have the downstage person pull the rope towards stage left so the rope is taught. With the rope taught,
or mostly taught, place the rope into the gap between the metal posts on the downstage master carrier, leaving a little slack,  and clamp the rope in place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you can feed the stage left part of the rope (the end that isn’t the one you’ve been working with this whole time) through the upstage vertical pulley,
like you did before with the other one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’re through the pulley pull that end of the rope to the upstage master carrier. Pull it so that you have about the same amount of slack on that end as on the other end, shove both ends into the gap in the metal posts and clamp them tightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_6.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Upstage Master Carrier Slack&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the rope is secured to the master carriers, you can start hanging the curtain on the hooks hanging from the carriers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hanging-the-curtain&quot;&gt;Hanging the Curtain&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dump each side of the curtains on their respective side of the stage, and unroll them enough so that you can hang them on the hooks.
You should bring all the carriers back to the offstage ends. Make sure the labeled side of the curtain is facing upstage, and start
hooking the hooks to the grommets on the curtain. The farthest offstage grommet hooks onto the single carrier that is ‘anchored’ offstage,
and the furthest onstage grommet hooks onto the hooks of the master carrier. There should be exactly as many hooks from the single and master carriers
as there are grommets on the curtain. Once all the hooks are attached to the grommets, you’re good to fly the Grand out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you fly it out, have someone watch the slack by the floor pulley and feed it so that it doesn’t catch on itself. If you’re able to fly the curtain all the way out
without picking up the pulley, you’re in luck you got the rope lengths mostly right on your first try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Try running the curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you can close the curtain and open it somewhat easily then congratulations!
You just built out what has historically been the most frustrating piece of equipment we own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;troubleshooting&quot;&gt;Troubleshooting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the stage right segment of rope is at the proper tension and length&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure you’ve left off the fold guides of the single carriers. These are the small holes on the little brackets that are connected by a small chain to the single carriers. In previous (incorrect) configurations of the Grand, the rope used to be threaded through these. This is no longer the case, as they seem to serve only to impede the movement of the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check to make sure the rope isn’t caught around the floor pulley. If it is you probably have too much slack on the stage left segment. Pull more through the upstage master carrier and reclamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;striking-the-grand&quot;&gt;Striking the Grand&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much just take everything apart that you set up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unclamp the ropes from the master carriers.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Re-attach the clamping bracket after the rope is off.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove and reserve the end stops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take the rope out of the carriers and pulleys (if the stage is bare, try and keep it off the wood)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Take all the carriers (except the ones anchored offstage) off the tracks
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;The best / most fun way is to hold a bin at the end off the track and just push them off the track into the bin&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Replace the End Stops&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the rope is somewhat neatly in the bin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;folding-the-curtains&quot;&gt;Folding the curtains&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Folding the curtains is easier to get wrong then you may think, and if you get it wrong you may not be able to fit the curtain in its bin,
which, writing from experience is extremely frustrating at the end of a long strike call. Thankfully it’s also easy to fold properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Begin by laying the curtain out flat (or as flat as it will get with its pleats).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Pull the bottom corners taught, then the top corners.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Make sure the center seam is relatively straight between the top and bottom of the curtain.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the curtain is laid out, you can fold it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have one person at one top corner and one person at the bottom corner of the same side. Together you’ll fold the curtain from one edge to the center seam.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Run and lift the curtain in a similar manner to how you would fold any other of our soft goods (try to catch air).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure that your fold aligns nicely with the seam, and make sure the fold is about as flat as it can be, not overlapping on itself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve checked that, fold the other side similarly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the other side is folded, you’re going to fold from the outside edges to the center again, similar to what you just did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It should look like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/grand_pics/grand_7.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Twice Folded&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you’ve completed the second fold to the center, you’re going to take one side and fold it over the center line to the seam on the other side.
The best way to do this is to get like four or so people to just pick the whole side up and place it across to the seam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now take the edge of the other side and fold it to the edge of the side you just folded (so over on itself). Once it’s all folded, roll from the bottom to the top.
The roll will be pretty thick, but it should fit nicely in the bin. Once that’s done, repeat the process for the other curtain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that, thank the Grand for its service and celebrate being done with it for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, party.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting Up monitors</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-monitors.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-monitors</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;The basic idea here is that you’re sending a certain mix of sounds back to the musicians so they can hear themselves better or other instruments that might be too quiet or far away for them to hear otherwise. This mix is, more often than not, different from the house mix that the audience hears. You are sending audio from a channel to an auxiliary output on the Venue (a separate output from the mains), which goes to the patchbay, then to a floorbox or AVP, then to a monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Grab a monitor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, figure out how many monitors will be needed by talking to the band or band leader.  Most musicians will only need one, but sometimes a drummer or lead singer will ask for two.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bring the monitor to stage and set it downstage of the musician who will be using it. Take a look at the direction the speakers inside are facing and try to point them toward the musician’s face. If you are using a Community M12 stage monitor, the square speaker (behind the grill) should be on the side closest to the musician.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find a SpeakOn cable with enough length to reach between the monitor and the nearest floorbox.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Connect either end of the cable to the floorbox (or AVP) Speakon output that you intend to use (just pick one, they’re all the same) and remember that number for patching.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Attach the other end of the speakon to the monitor itself. If there are two identical ports on the back of the monitor, one of them will be your input (usually the one on the left) and the other can be used to daisy chain a second monitor to this one.  However, if you forget which side is which, it does NOT matter; both ports are completely identical.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: when plugging in Speakon cable, make sure you push in the end, then twist it clockwise UNTIL IT LOCKS. These cords carry a lot of power, so it’s important that they are correctly fastened. To unlock, simply pull back the grey portion near the end and turn counterclockwise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Move to the Patchbay&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You will be working in the Speakon patchbay in the rack furthest to the right. They are labeled properly, so just think about what you are trying to do and re-check your output # if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The aux sends are split in the patchbay, so Aux #1 now has two outputs. Take a CROSSWIRED speakon cable, plug one end into the correct Venue aux output, and plug the other end into the corresponding floorbox/AVP port.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;At this point, you can now head back up to the board.  Find an assistant to confirm that each monitor is working. Then adjust the mix for each monitor as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Up at the Venue&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;You’ll first need to “set up” an aux in order to send signal from the board to the monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To set up an aux, first “select” the channel on the board that is holding your signal. That signal could be the microphone on stage, talkback mic at FOH, or from the channel holding your ipod.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Better yet, use the signal generator found in the Options/Miscellaneous tab and insert it by first turning the OUTPUT VOLUME to -inf dB. Click the volume control to turn it on, selecting the output that you wish to test (using the Select buttons on the Venue desk), and ONLY THEN turning up the volume on the signal Generator.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;The speakers in the Hall can produce Sound Pressure Levels that can permanently damage someones hearing even at a distance; always ensure that the volume is low before engaging the generator so as to ensure that we don’t deafen each other!&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you’ve got your signal ready and showing strength, select that channel and look on screen and find the “aux” section of the channel strip (it should be toward the top, just left of center). It will have 16 numbered round knobs. Click on the rotary knob (it will turn green) to turn it on, then adjust the rotary knob to your desired level.  Always start low and work your way up.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Now you’ve just sent the channel signal to the aux send, but you still need to send the aux send signal to the stage monitor itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;To do that, look over to the group of faders designated for sends on the board. It’s the group of 8 faders just left of the master fader.  Make sure you have selected the button labeled “Aux 1-8” so that you are in the right fader bank. Then, move the Aux #1 fader up to unity, or another good level.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is a good time to decide whether you want this aux to be pre- or post-fade.  Unless you have a valid reason to select otherwise, choose post-fade. This will give you the control of using the aux fader to boost or cut overall signal to that monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Base your levels and EQ solely on the feedback you get from your assistant on stage or the musician listening to it. From 100’ away, you have no clue what it sounds like. Talk to this person in depth to get a feel for how it sounds and how you could make it sound better.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

   <title>Setting Up a DI-Box</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-a-di-box.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/setting-up-a-di-box</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A DI-Box (Direct Input Box) allows you to connect high-impedance sources to a mixer without adverse effects.
The most common uses are for connecting electric keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and most forms of instrument pickups directly to the mixer without using an amp or microphone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the 1⁄4” TS cable from the instrument’s pick up into the DI (using the high-Z input)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug an XLR into the output of the DI and run that to a system input (floorbox, AVP, snake, etc).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If an amp is involved, but they still want a direct line as well, you’ll have to split the source.
Usually the musician will have his/her instrument plugged directly into the amp, so you’ll have to break this chain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Pull the plug from the amp input and insert it into either input of your DI box.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Grab a short instrument cable (1/4 inch TS usually) and plug into the THRU port of the DI and then back into the input of the amp.&lt;/li&gt;

   <title>Getting Sound From a Mic to the mains</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/mic-to-mains.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/mic-to-mains</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;setting-up-a-mic&quot;&gt;##Setting up a Mic&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find out who or what you are miking and how versatile they need to be during the show. Choose a
stand and mic accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find out where the mic needs to be placed on stage. Setup the stand, attach the clip, and slip the
mic into the clip. Make sure everything within the stand is tight.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the mic is wired and you are using a boom stand,
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Take your XLR cable and first plug the male end into the floorbox or AVP.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Carry the coil to the stand (when possible, follow along with other cables going in that same
direction) and drop the coil under the center of the stand.
￼￼￼￼￼* Run the female end up the stand, wrapping it around once.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;As you hit the boom, make sure the cord runs over the tightening pin.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Wrap the cord once more around the boom in the same direction.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Plug the female end into the mic, making sure the cord has enough slack at the end so that
the mic can be easily adjusted, but not so much that the cord is hanging all over.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Always leave the cable slack at the base of the mic stand, never at the input or somewhere in
between.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Try to run the cables in right angles when possible and along with other cables nearby. However,
avoid running microphone cables alongside AC power cables or SpeakOn unless absolutely
necessary;; this will generate noise in the signal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Any loose cables onstage or backstage should be taped down after soundcheck is complete, and
prior to doors opening. Remember to not tape down any mics that will need to move around during
the show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the mic is wireless, check to make sure the battery has at least two bars for a rehearsal setting
and three for a public performance. Batteries with less than two bars should be recycled in the
“dead battery” bin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-patchbay&quot;&gt;##The Patchbay&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This is where you will be connecting the signal directly to the SC48. Check the number on the floorbox or AVP input you plug into;; it should be in the format of the letter M then a sequence of ascending numbers, example: M12. Take a long-frame cable and run it from that input to whichever channel you intend to use on the mixing board. Use different colored cables to show different groups of mics (wired vs wireless or vocals vs instruments or input to split to SC48 vs booth).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;While patching, make sure the sound system is on by checking that the sequencer key is turned to “on” and that all its associated amps have turned on. While you’re doing this, check the subwoofer amp and turn on manually if needed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-the-venue-sc48&quot;&gt;##At the Venue SC48&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Turn on the Venue if it hasn’t been turned on yet. Once it is on, make sure all channels have been
muted or have their faders turned down. Then turn the master fader (at the far right) up to “unity”.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select each channel you have patched mics to and label them by double clicking on the “Channel #”
in the top left corner of the onscreen interface and naming what instrument or type of mic it is (“SL Vox” for stage left vocals, or “W1” for wireless mic #1). This makes it easier to keep track of your mics and keeps you from forgetting which channels are which.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are using a condenser mic, remember to mute the channel before turning on phantom power because the 48 volts will cause the mike to pop momentarily. If the mic is not muted, the entire house may hear an very loud and unpleasant sound. To engage phantom power:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Select the channel that needs the phantom.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Again, make sure the channel is MUTED and the fader is down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Press the 48V button near the top of the Venue.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Unmute, gain and then fader up.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Find someone assigned as or willing to temporarily be your audio assistant to test the mics. Have them first go to each mic and test that each one is working by gently tapping the grill of the mic. You are checking to see that you are getting signal to the channel;; if you see nothing, turn up the gain until you do. Remember to keep the channel muted and fader down while line checking.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Once you have completed the line check, you know all your patches are correct, and you have extra time and want to do things right, you can now do your pre-soundcheck soundcheck! Ask your assistant to go back to each mic and spend more time with each one. They should speak through vocal mic and play approved instruments, one at a time, to help you set gains and test monitors.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;During line check, confirm that each channel is going to the appropriate main speaker (LR or C). To do this, decide whether the sound from each independent channel should be coming out of the left and right speakers, the center speaker, or all three. * As a rule, vocalists should be routed to the center speaker only, instruments to the left and right and pre-recorded music again to just left and right (although left, center, and right is also an option if you need more level). On the board, select the channel, then choose the L/R or Center assigns from the master mains routing section.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Adjust the panning, limiter, comps, gate and effects (FX) as you see fit. These should all be adjusted pre-show;; turning any of these on mid-show would have to be done very gradually and strategically. When done improperly, you could lose sound completely and totally throw off a performance.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Double check that the speakers are at the the right height for the show.
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For a lecture or panel, the center speaker can be the only one down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Instrumental performances can have the left and right speakers down.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For use with the projection screen, left and right should be set below the break in the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For a film screening from the booth, fly the line array below the break in the screen.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point the basic loop of mic to patchbay to Venue to speakers is complete. There are a bunch of technical processes in there, but basic mic amplification is taking place, which can be enough for some musical performances and most lecture settings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pressing menu again will bring you back to the home screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;there-are-three-methods-of-taking-a-recording-in-the-penthouse&quot;&gt;There are three methods of taking a recording in the Penthouse:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure to test it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp;amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, send the file to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;erinbrenner@uchicago.edu
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Go to the website WeTransfer.com&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upload the recording to the site&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter Erin’s email address (above)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Enter your email address press Send.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Setting Up a Board Feed for a Videographer</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/board-feed-for-videographer.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/board-feed-for-videographer</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;If a group decides they would like a video recording of their event and has hired someone to do so, they may ask for an audio feed from the board. This videographer will probably be doing post production and wants direct raw mic feeds as opposed to using the distance mic on his camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The method for setting up a feed mirroring the board output would be similar to sending audio to a monitor, except that rather than sending the audio to the patchbay, you will be sending it directly to the video camera.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;First, run an XLR cord from one of the auxiliary outputs on the back of the board to the videographer. You may have to unplug one of the eight auxiliary outputs; remember to plug them back in after the event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Make sure the cord stays behind the chairs in the house and is taped down whenever it has to cross an aisle or walkway; if crossing an aisle, tape the XLR at the bottom of the steps where no one is likely to trip on it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If running a feed to the lower level, use very long cables and daisy chain two or more together;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Run them from the mixer ➝ straight out to the wall ➝ down the wall to the lower level ➝ back in to where the video is positioned.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Never run cable across a walkway and make sure they don’t either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the connection has been made, you will want to send the videographer a test signal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Select the aux you will be using (i.e. Aux #8), then use the mouse to click on System, then find the test signals sending a 100 Hz, 1000 Hz, 10000 Hz, White Noise, or Pink Noise.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Increase the level of sound until the videographer confirms he/she is receiving signal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you have confirmed that the camera is receiving signal, ask the videographer what kind of mix he/she would like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Say the videographer wants the house mix; you would need to send all of the audio at the same level as it is coming out of the mains, so you would select all of the channels that will potentially be going live during the event and send them at unity, postfade, to Aux #8, and then raise Aux #8 to unity as well, or to whatever level the videographer decides is best.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Do not adjust the aux level during the show, as it will make everything suddenly sound louder or softer mid-recording.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;If the videographer asks for only vocal mics or instrument mics, select the correct channels and send them to the correct aux.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In some cases the videographer may choose to do his/her own post-production sound editing, and may want a specific prefade mix. In this case, ask what they are looking for, and adjust accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Remember that sending a channel prefade means the aux will receive signal when the channel fades out, but not when the channel is muted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Aux Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A mixer input with limited control capabilities, intended for bringing the output of an auxiliary processor or other line-level source into the main mix bus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Input:&lt;/strong&gt; An input consists of two leads, neither of which is common to the circuit ground. This is a “differential pair”, where the signal consists of the difference in voltage between the two leads. Balanced input circuits can offer excellent rejection of common-mode noise induced into the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balanced Output:&lt;/strong&gt; In a classic balanced audio circuit, the output is carried on two leads (high/+ and low/-) which are isolated from the circuit ground by exactly the same impedance. A symmetrical balanced output carries the same signal at exactly the same level but of opposite polarity with respect to ground. A special case of a balanced output carries the signal on only one lead, with the other lead being at zero voltage with respect to ground, but at the same impedance as the signal-carrying lead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bandwidth&lt;/strong&gt;: The band of frequencies that pass through a device with a loss of less than 3dB, expressed in Hertz or in musical octaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cardioid:&lt;/strong&gt; Heart-shaped. In sound work, cardioid refers to the shape of the sensitivity vs. direction plot for a particular style of directional microphone. A cardioid mic rejects sound arriving from the rear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel:&lt;/strong&gt; A functional path in an audio circuit: an input channel, an output channel, a recording channel, the left channel and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Channel strip:&lt;/strong&gt; The physical realization of an audio channel on the front panel of a mixer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Clipping:&lt;/strong&gt; A form of severe audio distortion that results from peaks of the audio signal attempting to rise above the capabilities of the amplifier circuit. To avoid clipping, reduce the system gain in or before the gain stage in which the clipping occurs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Compressor:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a dynamic processor used to smooth out any large transient peaks in an audio signal that might otherwise overload your system or cause distortion. The amplitude threshold and other parameters such as attack time, release time, and ratio are adjustable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Condenser:&lt;/strong&gt; Condenser microphones require electrical power to run internal amplifiers and maintain an electrical charge on the capacitor. They are typically powered by internal batteries or “phantom power” supplied by an external source, such as a mixing console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cueing:&lt;/strong&gt; In broadcast, stage and post-production work, to “cue up” a sound or video source (a record, a sound effect on a CD, a song on a tape) means to get it ready for playback by making sure you are in the right position on the “cue,” making sure the level and EQ are all set properly. This requires a special monitoring circuit that only the mixing engineer hears. It does not go out on the air or to the main mixing buses. Cueing can also refer to a similar process regarding video playback.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;D/A converter:&lt;/strong&gt; Digital-to-analog converter, a device that transforms incoming digital signal into analog form.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decibel (dB):&lt;/strong&gt; A unit used to measure the intensity of a sound or the power level of an electrical signal by comparing it with a given level on a logarithmic scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Delay:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound work, delay usually refers to an electronic circuit or effects unit whose purpose it is to delay the audio signal for some short period of time. Delay can refer to one short repeat, a series of repeats or the complex interactions of delay used in chorusing or reverb. When delayed signals are mixed back with the original sound, a great number of audio effects can be generated, including phasing and flanging, doubling, Haas precedence-effect panning, slap or slapback, echo, regenerative echo, chorusing and hall-like reverberation. Signal time delay is central to many audio effects units.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dry:&lt;/strong&gt; Usually means without reverberation, or without some other applied effect like delay or chorus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic microphone:&lt;/strong&gt; The class of microphones that generate electrical signals by the movement of a coil in a magnetic field. Dynamic microphones are rugged, relatively inexpensive, capable of very good performance and do not require external power.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Equalization (EQ):&lt;/strong&gt; Refers to purposefully changing the frequency response of a circuit, sometimes to correct for previous unequal response (hence the term, equalization), and more often to boost or cut the level at certain frequencies for sound enhancement, to remove extraneous sounds, or to create completely new and different sounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Frequency:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of times an event repeats itself in a given period of time. The audio frequency range is generally considered to be 20 Hz to 20, 000 Hz. This covers the fundamental pitch and most overtones of musical instruments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gain:&lt;/strong&gt; The measure of how much a circuit amplifies a signal. Gain may be stated as a ratio of input to output voltage, current or power, such as a voltage gain of 4, or a power gain of 1.5, or it can be expressed in decibels, such as a line amplifier with a gain of 10dB.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gate:&lt;/strong&gt; A dynamics processor that automatically turns off an input signal when it drops below a certain level. This can reduce the overall noise level of your mix by turning off inputs when they are not in use. Threshold, attack time, hold, and release time are some of the adjustable gate parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Graphic EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A graphic equalizer uses slide pots for its boost/cut controls, with its operating frequencies evenly spaced through the audio spectrum. In a perfect world, a line drawn through the centers of thecontrol shafts would form a graph of the frequency response curve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ground:&lt;/strong&gt; Also called earth. Ground is defined as the point of zero voltage in a circuit or system, the reference point from which all other voltages are measured.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In electrical power systems, ground connections are used for safety purposes, to keep equipment chassis and controls at zero voltage and to provide a safe path for errant currents. This is called a safety ground. Maintaining a good safety ground is essential to prevent electrical shock.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In sensitive electronic equipment, tiny currents and voltages riding on the ground (so it’s not truly zero volts) can cause noise in the circuits and hamper operation. Often a ground separate from the power ground is used as the reference point for the electronics, isolating the sensitive electronics from the dirty power ground. This is called a technical ground.
Hertz: The unit of frequency, equal to 1 cycle per second. Abbreviated Hz. kHz = 1000 Hz, and is usually pronounced “kay” (with “Hertz” implied) by sound professionals who ask for “a little more two and a half K” when they want you to boost 2.5 kHz (2500Hz).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Impedance:&lt;/strong&gt; A measure of the AC resistance, capacitance, and inductance in an electrical circuit, measured in ohms;; all of these three properties impede the flow of current. AKA: the higher the impedance, the lower the current. In audio circuits (and other AC circuits) the impedance in ohms can often be much different from the circuit resistance as measured by a DC ohmmeter. Maintaining proper circuit impedance relationships is important to avoid distortion and minimize added noise.
Level: Another word for signal voltage, power, strength or volume. Audio signals are sometimes classified according to their level. Commonly used levels are: microphone level (-40 dBu or lower), instrument level (-20 to -10 dBu), and line level (-10 to +30 dBu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;￼￼￼￼￼&lt;strong&gt;Line level:&lt;/strong&gt;  A signal whose level falls between -10 dBu and +30 dBu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main (house) speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; The main loudspeakers for a sound reinforcement system. These are usually the largest and loudest loudspeakers, and are usually positioned so that their sound seems to come from the area of the main stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Master:&lt;/strong&gt; A control affecting the final output of a bus on which one or more signals are mixed. A mixer may have several master controls, which may be slide faders or rotary controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic level:&lt;/strong&gt; The typical level of a signal from a microphone. A mic level signal (usually but not always coming from a microphone) is generally lower than -30 dBu. With a very quiet source (a pin dropping?) the signal can be -70 dBu or lower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mic preamp:&lt;/strong&gt; Short for microphone preamplifier. An amplifier whose job is to bring the very low microphone level signal up to line level, or in the case of a mic preamp built into a mixer, the mixer’s internal operating level (approximately 0 dBu). Mic preamps often have their own volume control, called a trim control, to properly set the gain for a particular source. Setting the mic preamp gain correctly with the trim control is an essential step in establishing good signal-to-noise ratio and sufficient headroom for your mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitor:&lt;/strong&gt; In sound reinforcement, monitor speakers (or monitor headphones or in-the-ear monitors) are
those speakers used by the performers to hear themselves. In recording, the monitor speakers are those used by the engineer and production staff to listen to the recording as it progresses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Noise:&lt;/strong&gt; Whatever you don’t want to hear. Could be hum, buzz or hiss;; could be crosstalk or digital hash or your neighbor’s stereo;; could be white noise or pink noise or brown noise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Normal:&lt;/strong&gt; A wiring method which electrically ties together two jacks or two poles of one jack so that in normal operation, there is signal flow between them. Inserting a plug breaks this connection, allowing the signal path to be modified. Normal wiring is common in patchbays and insert jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PA:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Public Address. An electronic amplification system used as a communication system in public areas. Today, people who work with PA systems like to say they’re working in “sound reinforcement”. Pan, pan pot: Short for panoramic potentiometer. A pan pot is used to position (or even dynamically move) a monaural sound source in a stereo mixing field by adjusting the source’s volume between the left and right channels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Patch bay:&lt;/strong&gt; A collection of usually a large number of jacks allowing convenient access to various points in a system’s interconnect wiring. A patch bay can make re-routing signals very convenient without having to fish around with cables in the back of racks or consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Parametric EQ:&lt;/strong&gt; A “fully” parametric EQ is an extremely powerful equalizer that allows smooth, continuous, and independent control of each of the three primary EQ parameters: frequency, gain, and bandwidth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PFL:&lt;/strong&gt; An acronym for Pre Fade Listen. Sound folks call it being able to solo a channel with the fader down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phantom Power:&lt;/strong&gt; A system of providing electrical power for condenser microphones (and some electronic pickup devices) from the microphone input jack;; it provides +48V across two pins in a 3-pin XLR. The system is called phantom because the power is carried on standard microphone audio wiring in a way that is “invisible” to ordinary dynamic microphones. Generally, phantom power is safe to use with non-condenser microphones as well, especially dynamic microphones. However, unbalanced microphones, some electronic equipment (such as some wireless microphone receivers) and some ribbon microphones can short out the phantom power and be severely damaged. Be careful!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Phase:&lt;/strong&gt; The time relationship between two signals, expressed in degrees around a circle. 0 and 360 degrees represents an in-phase relationship – both signals change in the same way at the same time. Anything else
is out of phase. 180 degrees out of phase is a special case which, for a continuous waveform, means that at any given time the two signals have the same amplitude but are opposite in polarity. The phase reverse switch found on some mixers or mic preamps actually reverses the signal polarity. When out-of-phase signals are mixed, there will be some cancellation at certain frequencies, the frequencies and the degree of cancellation being a function of the amount of phase shift and the relative amplitude of the signals. Attention to mic placement and careful listening will allow you to use this effect creatively.
￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼￼&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pre-fader:&lt;/strong&gt; A term used to describe an aux send (or other output) that is connected so that it is not affected by the setting of the associated channel fader. Sends connected this way are typically (but not always) used for monitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Return:&lt;/strong&gt; A return is a mixer line input dedicated to the task of returning processed or added sound from reverb, echo and other effects devices. Depending on the internal routing of your mixer and your own inclination, you could use returns as additional line inputs, or you could route your reverb outputs to ordinary line inputs rather than the returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reverb:&lt;/strong&gt; The sound remaining in a room after the source of sound is stopped. Reverberation and echo are terms that are often used interchangeably, but in audio parlance a distinction is usually made: reverberation is considered to be a diffuse, continuously smooth decay of sound, whereas echo is one or more distinct, recognizable repetitions of a word, note, phrase or sound which decreases in amplitude with every repeat. Highly reverberant rooms are called live;; rooms with very little reverberation are called dead. A sound source without added reverb is dry;; one with reverb or echo added is wet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Signal-to-noise ratio:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a specification that describes how much noise an audio component has compared to the signal. It is usually expressed in dB below a given output level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Surround sound:&lt;/strong&gt; Multi-channel audio playback systems in 6, 8, or 10-channel formats. Surround sound is typically found in movie theaters and home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TRS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Ring-Sleeve, the three parts of a two-conductor (plus shield) phone plug. Since the plug or jack can carry two signals and a common ground, TRS connectors are often referred to as stereo or balanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TS:&lt;/strong&gt; Acronym for Tip-Sleeve, the two parts of a single conductor (plus shield) phone plug. TS connectors are sometimes called mono or unbalanced plugs or jacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unbalanced:&lt;/strong&gt; An electrical circuit in which the two legs of the circuit do not have the identical impedance to ground. Often one leg is also at ground potential. Unbalanced circuit connections require only two conductors (signal “hot” and ground). Unbalanced audio circuitry is less expensive to build, but under certain circumstances is more susceptible to noise pickup.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Audio Equipment and Set-Up</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/audio/equipment-and-setup.html"/>
   <updated>2016-08-26T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/audio/audio-equipment-and-setup</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;stands--safety&quot;&gt;###Stands &amp;amp; Safety&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hall has two basic types of stands: boom stands and straight stands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Straight stands:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Given that they are less versatile than boom stands, straight stands are generally used to hold microphones for vocal performance or speaking. We usually use straight stands for wireless mics because they are easier to move around the stage, but they can take any standard mic clip. Our straight stands have a heavy round base and an adjustable neck. The connector at the neck twists right to tighten and left to loosen;; adjust the stand to the appropriate height and tighten the neck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Boom stands:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Given that they can be contorted into good positions for picking up sounds from many different instruments (including drums, strings, brass, woodwinds, etc), boom stands are more adept for miking instruments. When using a wired mic on a boom stand, the cable should be wrapped a couple of times across the length of the boom, over the pin, and down the length of the stand. Do not wrap the cord too many times;; just enough to keep it from flailing everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Safety:&lt;/strong&gt;
 Each time you want to make a change to a stand, loosen one joint, adjust the length/direction, tighten and move on to the next joint until the stand acts how you want it to and will hold the weight of the mic you’re about to put on it. Pay attention to how the legs are aligned when you position the stand. If the stand seems unstable, position it so that one of it’s legs is directly under the boom arm. Make sure every joint is tight before walking away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When disassembling, also remember to work with one joint at a time. It is very easy to get your fingers
￼￼￼pinched between the moving parts, so be very careful when adjusting and always tighten! The goal when disassembling, is to minimize the space it takes up, so shorten all lengths and align all arms and legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cables&quot;&gt;###Cables&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Performance Hall uses XLR, TRS, Mini TRS, SpeakOn, Cross-wired SpeakOn, Ethernet and Longframe patchbay cables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;XLR:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most frequently used cord in the hall for passing audio signal. Three-pin XLR cords are able to pass a balanced signal that travels farther than unbalanced signal. Generally XLR cords run from a wired microphone and into Floorboxes, AV panels off-stage (AVPs), or to a snake.
The hall has 10’, 25’, and 50’ XLR, stored on the bottom shelf of the backstage cabinet. When running cable from a mic to a floorbox input, you should look at the length from the stand to the input and choose a cable length that will give you a few feet of slack, as performers may move the stands during soundcheck and occasionally midshow. Leave the slack at the base of the mic stand and not near the input location or somewhere in between.
If the stands will be in the same place during the whole show, you should tape down all the cables in order to create a safer walking space for the performers and a cleaner look for the audience. When taping on stage use the brown gaff tape;; it will blend into the wood and make the stage look cleaner. Any backstage cable taping should be in black gaff as it is less expensive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1⁄4” TRS Instrument Cable:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as 1⁄4” cable, “tip, ring, sleeve” or instrument cable. We don’t stock a variety of lengths in the hall because musicians typically bring their own. We do own a few shorter patch length 1⁄4” cables that could run from an amp, keyboard or an instrument with a pick-up to a DI box. These are kept in the storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mini TRS:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also known as 1⁄8”, 3.5mm or aux cable, are commonly used audio cables for connecting phones, ipods and computers to an audio system. While these devices normally have an 1⁄8” input, you often need to convert it to an XLR or 1⁄4” output when connecting to a mixer. In the hall we have a TRS 1⁄8” to stereo XLR cable connected to the mixer at FOH for device connection, but we keep a spare in the storage closet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SpeakOn:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Used for running sound to floor wedges/monitors, usually from Floorboxes or AVPs. SpeakOn cables vary in length, so choose the appropriate length for each monitor. Floor Monitors that use a SpeakOn input usually will not require any external power;; all the monitors we have are “passive” and therefore do not require any external AC power adaptor. SpeakOn is stored on the audio shelf next to the backstage cabinet.
Crosswired SpeakOn: ONLY used in the patchbay for connecting Venue outputs to the appropriate floorbox or AVP connections. These cords are about 2.5’ and stay in the amp room at all times;; they are marked CROSS on the neck of the cable.
Long-frame/Military cords [Patchbay cords]: Green, red, and black cable used in the patchbay to connect mic inputs to the Venue or Recording Booth. Also used to split signal when necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;coiling-cables&quot;&gt;###Coiling Cables&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two methods for coiling an XLR cable and there is much debate as to which is better. In the hall, we use the “over/under” method. This same method can be used to coil almost all other audio cables.
￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼First, hold the female end of the cable in your left hand with the connector pointed toward you. Pull your right hand out along the cable until you reach about 18” and bring that length up into your left hand while guiding
it into becoming your first loop. Pay attention to the direction your right hand rotates as you guide the cable into making this first loop. You are about move your right hand in the exact opposite direction when making the second loop.
After grabbing this first loop in your left hand, pull another 18” with your right hand. This time you’ll loop it up under itself, by twisting in the opposite direction, and again place it in your left hand. The cable should still be moving in the same direction, away from you, it’ll just be coming in from underneath the current coil.
Continue repeating these two steps “over and under) until you hit the end of your cable. Inspect the cable for a proper coil and then use the velcro tie attached to secure. It should look like a series of same sized loops, no figure 8’s. If yours has a figure 8, you must start over. If you have both large and small loops within one coil, start over. If one of your tails is way longer than the other, fix it by adjusting the position of the velcro.
If you have a hard time getting good coils, use this video to help while practicing: http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/04/use-these-alternating-coil-methods-for-knot-free-cables/&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;speakers&quot;&gt;###Speakers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Main speakers:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as the “mains”. In the Performance Hall our mains are in a L-C-R (left, center, right) configuration. They are Electro-Voice, or “EV” brand speakers, model: Xi2123A/106, and are flown to heights controllable from the automated rigging system “Scene Control”. The projection system has its own surround sound system with a L-C-R EAW KF740 Line Array.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monitors:&lt;/strong&gt; Also known as “wedges” or “floor wedges”. We have 3 different monitor speakers;; 3 of the smaller 12” EV’s (TX 1122 FM), 2 of the 15” EV’s (TX 1152 FM), and 2 of the 12” Community (M12’s). Monitors should be placed in front of a musician who needs to hear himself, or his fellow musicians, more clearly. While the EV’s need to be set further away from the artist because of how the speakers are pointed within the wedge, the Communities have a wider range and can be placed much closer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Subs:&lt;/strong&gt; We own 2 EV X-SUB’s that live in the work lofts to the left and right of downstage. The subs supply the low end frequencies to both the main and projection systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidefills:&lt;/strong&gt; The 2 side fills we have, EV Zx1’s, are built into the downstage left and right walls, just where the plank design ends. The side fills are also tied to both the main speakers and the projection audio system.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">### Before the Show

* When you arrive, uncover and turn on the Venue SC48; store the cover under the console.
* Turn on the sequencer (the key in the upper section of the left rack in the patchbay). Also, turn on the sub amp (the lower right hand section of the rack) by pressing the on button.
* Confirm with visiting artists their music, video, and whether they need any equipment.
* Set up your archival recording and test that it is getting level.
  * Always set up a backup wireless mic on a straight stand off stage left (in a place where the audience won’t see them every time the stage door opens) to easily deal with any last minute mic requests.
  * Make sure the batteries are fresh if you are about to go into a show.
  * Use half-life batteries or rechargeable batteries if you are in a rehearsal.
  * Throw dead batteries into the dead battery bin.

* **Microphones**

    * Set up requested microphones backstage and/or onstage.
    * Fly speakers in to the appropriate height based on the type of performance.
    * Fly in the banners if there will be amplified music or speaking.  Make sure you do not fly banners in front of the stage camera or the projection window if projection will be in use.
    * If using wireless mics, check all batteries and consider sleeving the mics.
    * Patch microphones in the patch bay from your “M” inputs on stage to the Venue by using the TRS cables hanging in the amp room (the red, green, and black cords).

* **Monitors**

    * Always set up monitors if someone will be singing through a microphone on stage.  Often, instrumental groups with multiple mics will want monitors in order to hear each other better.
    * Patch monitors in the speakon patchbay, from Venue outputs to stage inputs, using the short CROSSWIRED speakon cables found in the amp room only. DO NOT use regular speakon cable - they are wired differently and can damage the gear.

* **Soundcheck**

  * Before the band arrives, if possible, do a line check to make sure that each microphone and monitor is passing signal.  To line check, have your audio assistant speak into each mic, one at a time, in order to pre-set general gains. Deal with phantom needs and troubleshoot any patching issues.  Next, have your assistant stand near each monitor while you send signal, one at a time, to confirm the monitors are patched correctly.
  * It is good practice to ring out the monitors before the artists arrive as well.
  * Once the band arrives, start sound checking each mic, focusing on one instrument at a time. If you are checking drums, have the drummer go through his whole kit, one drum/cymbal at a time, while you work with the EQ, comp, gate, etc for each one.  After you have them all dialed in, ask him/her to play the whole set so that you can further tweak (pan, groups, hi-pass, etc).
  * Make sure the musician is hearing the right amount of everything through their monitor; don’t move on to the next musician until each person is happy. If they specifically ask for “everything” it’s important that you don’t give them everything.  In this situation, only give them the most important aspects for clarity’s sake (themselves, vocals, kick drum, lead guitar, whatever that might be).  If you give them everything, they’ll need more of everything and it will become a huge mess.
  * If you are mixing a digital instrument such as keyboard, dj rig or sampler, ask them to reproduce their loudest patch so that you can set your gain to that level.
  * When you finish with the last musician and everyone seems happy with their rough mixes, ask the whole group to play a half song together while you walk the room to hear the mix from different listening perspectives - tweak issues accordingly.  When the group stops playing, they will have many requests, deal with each request, one at a time.  Once everyone seems happy, ask them to try a different half song and repeat the whole process until they are happy with the stage mix and you are happy with the house mix.
  * Make sure audio cables (only cables that will stay in place for the whole show) are taped down when in high traffic walk ways - brown gaff tape onstage, black offstage.
  * Determine if there will be any videographers in house and whether or not they need a board feed. Set that up for them ahead of time.  If the videographer shows up after doors are open, you will not be able to send them a feed down to the lower level.  They will have to record from the upper level next to FOH. Make sure their power cables do not run across the house walkways.

---

### During the Show

* If you are tasked with recording the performance, remember to PRESS RECORD(!!) in the minutes leading up to the start of the show. Make sure the device is actually recording and picking up signal.
* Follow along with the program, and any notes you’ve taken, to make sure you turn the correct mic on each time someone is about to speak and then mute it when they travel off stage.
* Communicate with the stage manager, especially when mics are coming on and off the stage throughout the show so you know which mics to take live.
* Use good judgment when deciding whose mics to mute during panels and Q&amp;A’s. Sometime panelists will make a lot of noise when they aren’t speaking, so it might be good to mute their mics if someone else is speaking for a long period of time. To do this well, you will have to have all your fingers on the mutes or faders ready to pull the trigger before they decide to speak up.
* Use your headphones to solo channels in order to find any problem areas that you notice now but didn’t notice during soundcheck.
* Leave your ClearCom in a visible place so that you can see calls coming in. The stage manager may need to reach you to communicate, and without that visual you may never know.

---

### After the Show

* Mute the audio console and head down to stage to begin strike. Play some quiet music if you’d like.
* Before doing anything, attempt to troubleshoot any issues you realized during the show. Test suspect mics, cables, patches, systems, channels, etc before striking. Immediately, send an email to Erin about the problem, when it happened, how you dealt with it and the current status.  Leave the broken gear up in #243 on the secondary desk in Erin’s office.
* Strike all mics, monitors, stands and cable and restore them to their default “home” positions. Remember to keep mic clips with their mic and mic bag, not with the stand.
* Pull up all your tape from the floor.
* Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).
* Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.
* Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.
* Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.
* Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.
* If you made an archival recording:
  * In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
  * If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
* If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.
* If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.

   <title>Genie Use and Safety</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2016/04/14/genie-guide/"/>
   <updated>2016-04-14T00:00:00-05:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2016/04/14/genie-guide</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A genie is a kind of lift. The Logan Center has two Genies available for Performance Hall use, one with a maximum height of 25’ and one with 30’. The trim (height) of the ceiling in the Performance Hall is 30’, so always take the 30’ Genie if you are working in the hall. They are usually located in the back hallways past the vending machines. Ask for help if you have a hard time finding one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;basic-safety-tips&quot;&gt;Basic safety tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie alone when no one else is in the space.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Always have a buddy on the ground. If you are the buddy on the ground, never stand directly under the bucket for the reason following.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you are up in the bucket, make sure all your tools are tied to you.  Any loose parts could potentially fall onto your buddy from 30’ and cause serious damage to his/her head and face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Because of liability issues, never attempt to push someone while the bucket is up in the air.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be aware of your surroundings while flying up in the Genie. Do not go up any further if you are about to hit the architecture of the hall or the ceiling.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never use the Genie on an unlevel surface.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overextend yourself while in the Genie. Instead, come down, move the Genie, and go back up so you can reach whatever you need.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The Genie runs on a battery. When not in use, it should be turned off (switched to the center position). For overnight storage, unplug the battery from the machine and plug the battery directly in to the wall. If it dies while in use, get an extension cord and plug it in to a floor pocket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be ultra aware of any cabling on the ground while moving the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Do not overload the bucket with equipment. If you need to shuttle things from above to the ground, bring a rope up with you. Tie it off to the genie and be extremely careful when lowering or raising goods and those standing nearby.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have lights in the bucket with you, attach the safety clip to the railing before flying up or down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Never have more than one person in the Genie.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you go up and feel uncomfortable, come back down. The Genie is stable if used correctly, even if it does not always feel that way when it is fully extended. You are safe in the Genie. Try to conquer your fear, as the more nervous you are, the more your legs will shake, and the more the Genie will quake. If you still feel too uncomfortable, switch places with your ground buddy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are locked, the Genie can go both up and down.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If the legs are not locked, the Genie can go down but not up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-use-the-genie&quot;&gt;To use the genie&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unplug the Genie battery from the wall. Coil the extension cord and tuck it in the nook next to the battery. Reconnect the Genie itself to the battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Open the stage wall panels to allow the genie onto stage without damaging the woodwork.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Place the Genie where you need it onstage. You can estimate where you will end up by peeking up through the bucket up above.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the right, so you have platform selected rather than ground control.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the legs into each of their holes and allow the pin to click into place. Tighten the feet just enough for their corresponding lights to turn green on the panel.  I suggest exactly 5-6 rotations after the foot stops spinning (doing each leg exactly the same for uniformity) and then check the sensor to see if any didn’t get activated.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the bubble level (located on the base of the Genie). If the bubble is not inside the circle, loosen one side and tighten the other. Adjust until you are level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Climb into the bucket.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make sure the emergency stops (both big red buttons) are pulled out.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If everything is good and for some reason the Genie won’t allow you to move, check both of these emergency stop buttons. One may have gotten pressed accidentally by someone bumping into it.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go up, from inside the bucket, push and hold the small black button while flipping the switch so the white line is going up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;To go down, push the same black button and flip the switch so the white line is going down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;to-put-the-genie-away&quot;&gt;To put the genie away&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Lower the bucket down all the way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remove the legs by loosening the feet completely and pulling the bolts to release the legs.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the legs in the slots on the side. Remember to alternate the direction of the feet.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Turn the key to the “off” position in the center.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Store the Genie back in it’s home.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Disconnect the lift from its battery pack.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Plug the battery pack into the wall to charge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the event of an emergency while using the Genie, such as your bucket suddenly moving without you pressing anything, press in the large red emergency “stop” button and it will stop.  If someone is stuck in the bucket while up in the air, don’t panic, don’t jump, call for help.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Introducing Lanyon</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2014/01/02/introducing-lanyon/"/>
   <updated>2014-01-02T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2014/01/02/introducing-lanyon</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is an unassuming &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; theme that places content first by tucking away navigation in a hidden drawer. It’s based on &lt;a href=&quot;http://getpoole.com&quot;&gt;Poole&lt;/a&gt;, the Jekyll butler.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;built-on-poole&quot;&gt;Built on Poole&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/mdo&quot;&gt;@mdo&lt;/a&gt;. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Lanyon here) includes the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, &lt;a href=&quot;/404&quot;&gt;404&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;/atom.xml&quot;&gt;RSS feed&lt;/a&gt;, posts, and &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;example page&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Mobile friendly design and development&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Easily scalable text and component sizing with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rem&lt;/code&gt; units in the CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lanyon-features&quot;&gt;Lanyon features&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the features of Poole, Lanyon adds the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toggleable sliding sidebar (built with only CSS) via &lt;strong&gt;☰&lt;/strong&gt; link in top corner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#reverse-layout&quot;&gt;reverse&lt;/a&gt; (right sidebar), available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#themes&quot;&gt;Eight optional color schemes&lt;/a&gt;, available via &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; classes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon#readme&quot;&gt;Head to the readme&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;browser-support&quot;&gt;Browser support&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;download&quot;&gt;Download&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lanyon is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/poole/lanyon&quot;&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;div class=&quot;message&quot;&gt;
  Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis &lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;dis parturient montes&lt;/a&gt;, nascetur ridiculus mus. &lt;em&gt;Aenean eu leo quam.&lt;/em&gt; Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Etiam porta &lt;strong&gt;sem malesuada magna&lt;/strong&gt; mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;inline-html-elements&quot;&gt;Inline HTML elements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element&quot;&gt;Mozilla Developer Network&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To bold text&lt;/strong&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;strong&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;To italicize text&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;em&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Abbreviations, like &lt;abbr title=&quot;HyperText Markup Langage&quot;&gt;HTML&lt;/abbr&gt; should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, with an optional &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute for the full phrase.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Citations, like &lt;cite&gt;— Mark otto&lt;/cite&gt;, should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;cite&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;Deleted&lt;/del&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;del&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;ins&gt;inserted&lt;/ins&gt; text should use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;ins&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Superscript &lt;sup&gt;text&lt;/sup&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sup&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and subscript &lt;sub&gt;text&lt;/sub&gt; uses &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;sub&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;heading&quot;&gt;Heading&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vivamus sagittis lacus vel augue rutrum faucibus dolor auctor. Duis mollis, est non commodo luctus, nisi erat porttitor ligula, eget lacinia odio sem nec elit. Morbi leo risus, porta ac consectetur ac, vestibulum at eros.&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>What's Jekyll?</title>
   <link href="performancehall.github.io/2013/12/31/whats-jekyll/"/>
   <updated>2013-12-31T00:00:00-06:00</updated>
   <id>performancehall.github.io/2013/12/31/whats-jekyll</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is a static site generator, an open-source tool for creating simple yet powerful websites of all shapes and sizes. From &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/blob/master/README.markdown&quot;&gt;the project’s readme&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Jekyll is a simple, blog aware, static site generator. It takes a template directory […] and spits out a complete, static website suitable for serving with Apache or your favorite web server. This is also the engine behind GitHub Pages, which you can use to host your project’s page or blog right here from GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s an immensely useful tool and one we encourage you to use here with Lanyon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find out more by &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll&quot;&gt;visiting the project on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
