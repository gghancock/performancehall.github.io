    <h3 id="stands--safety">Stands &amp; Safety</h3>
<hr />
<p>The hall has two basic types of stands: boom stands and straight stands.</p>

<p><strong>Straight stands:</strong>
 Given that they are less versatile than boom stands, straight stands are generally used to hold microphones for vocal performance or speaking. We usually use straight stands for wireless mics because they are easier to move around the stage, but they can take any standard mic clip. Our straight stands have a heavy round base and an adjustable neck. The connector at the neck twists right to tighten and left to loosen;; adjust the stand to the appropriate height and tighten the neck.</p>

<p><strong>Boom stands:</strong>
 Given that they can be contorted into good positions for picking up sounds from many different instruments (including drums, strings, brass, woodwinds, etc), boom stands are more adept for miking instruments. When using a wired mic on a boom stand, the cable should be wrapped a couple of times across the length of the boom, over the pin, and down the length of the stand. Do not wrap the cord too many times;; just enough to keep it from flailing everywhere.</p>

<p><strong>Safety:</strong>
 Each time you want to make a change to a stand, loosen one joint, adjust the length/direction, tighten and move on to the next joint until the stand acts how you want it to and will hold the weight of the mic you’re about to put on it. Pay attention to how the legs are aligned when you position the stand. If the stand seems unstable, position it so that one of it’s legs is directly under the boom arm. Make sure every joint is tight before walking away from it.</p>

<p>When disassembling, also remember to work with one joint at a time. It is very easy to get your fingers
￼￼￼pinched between the moving parts, so be very careful when adjusting and always tighten! The goal when disassembling, is to minimize the space it takes up, so shorten all lengths and align all arms and legs.</p>

<h3 id="cables">Cables</h3>
<hr />

<p>The Performance Hall uses XLR, TRS, Mini TRS, SpeakOn, Cross-wired SpeakOn, Ethernet and Longframe patchbay cables.</p>

<p><strong>XLR:</strong></p>

<p>The most frequently used cord in the hall for passing audio signal. Three-pin XLR cords are able to pass a balanced signal that travels farther than unbalanced signal. Generally XLR cords run from a wired microphone and into Floorboxes, AV panels off-stage (AVPs), or to a snake.
The hall has 10’, 25’, and 50’ XLR, stored on the bottom shelf of the backstage cabinet. When running cable from a mic to a floorbox input, you should look at the length from the stand to the input and choose a cable length that will give you a few feet of slack, as performers may move the stands during soundcheck and occasionally midshow. Leave the slack at the base of the mic stand and not near the input location or somewhere in between.
If the stands will be in the same place during the whole show, you should tape down all the cables in order to create a safer walking space for the performers and a cleaner look for the audience. When taping on stage use the brown gaff tape;; it will blend into the wood and make the stage look cleaner. Any backstage cable taping should be in black gaff as it is less expensive.</p>

<p><strong>1⁄4” TRS Instrument Cable:</strong></p>

<p>Also known as 1⁄4” cable, “tip, ring, sleeve” or instrument cable. We don’t stock a variety of lengths in the hall because musicians typically bring their own. We do own a few shorter patch length 1⁄4” cables that could run from an amp, keyboard or an instrument with a pick-up to a DI box. These are kept in the storage closet.</p>

<p><strong>Mini TRS:</strong></p>

<p>Also known as 1⁄8”, 3.5mm or aux cable, are commonly used audio cables for connecting phones, ipods and computers to an audio system. While these devices normally have an 1⁄8” input, you often need to convert it to an XLR or 1⁄4” output when connecting to a mixer. In the hall we have a TRS 1⁄8” to stereo XLR cable connected to the mixer at FOH for device connection, but we keep a spare in the storage closet.</p>

<p><strong>SpeakOn:</strong></p>

<p>Used for running sound to floor wedges/monitors, usually from Floorboxes or AVPs. SpeakOn cables vary in length, so choose the appropriate length for each monitor. Floor Monitors that use a SpeakOn input usually will not require any external power;; all the monitors we have are “passive” and therefore do not require any external AC power adaptor. SpeakOn is stored on the audio shelf next to the backstage cabinet.
Crosswired SpeakOn: ONLY used in the patchbay for connecting Venue outputs to the appropriate floorbox or AVP connections. These cords are about 2.5’ and stay in the amp room at all times;; they are marked CROSS on the neck of the cable.
Long-frame/Military cords [Patchbay cords]: Green, red, and black cable used in the patchbay to connect mic inputs to the Venue or Recording Booth. Also used to split signal when necessary.</p>

<h3 id="coiling-cables">Coiling Cables</h3>
<hr />
<p>There are two methods for coiling an XLR cable and there is much debate as to which is better. In the hall, we use the “over/under” method. This same method can be used to coil almost all other audio cables.
￼￼￼￼￼￼
￼First, hold the female end of the cable in your left hand with the connector pointed toward you. Pull your right hand out along the cable until you reach about 18” and bring that length up into your left hand while guiding
it into becoming your first loop. Pay attention to the direction your right hand rotates as you guide the cable into making this first loop. You are about move your right hand in the exact opposite direction when making the second loop.
After grabbing this first loop in your left hand, pull another 18” with your right hand. This time you’ll loop it up under itself, by twisting in the opposite direction, and again place it in your left hand. The cable should still be moving in the same direction, away from you, it’ll just be coming in from underneath the current coil.
Continue repeating these two steps “over and under) until you hit the end of your cable. Inspect the cable for a proper coil and then use the velcro tie attached to secure. It should look like a series of same sized loops, no figure 8’s. If yours has a figure 8, you must start over. If you have both large and small loops within one coil, start over. If one of your tails is way longer than the other, fix it by adjusting the position of the velcro.
If you have a hard time getting good coils, use this video to help while practicing: http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2012/04/use-these-alternating-coil-methods-for-knot-free-cables/</p>

<h3 id="speakers">Speakers</h3>
<hr />
<p><strong>Main speakers:</strong> Also known as the “mains”. In the Performance Hall our mains are in a L-C-R (left, center, right) configuration. They are Electro-Voice, or “EV” brand speakers, model: Xi2123A/106, and are flown to heights controllable from the automated rigging system “Scene Control”. The projection system has its own surround sound system with a L-C-R EAW KF740 Line Array.</p>

<p><strong>Monitors:</strong> Also known as “wedges” or “floor wedges”. We have 3 different monitor speakers;; 3 of the smaller 12” EV’s (TX 1122 FM), 2 of the 15” EV’s (TX 1152 FM), and 2 of the 12” Community (M12’s). Monitors should be placed in front of a musician who needs to hear himself, or his fellow musicians, more clearly. While the EV’s need to be set further away from the artist because of how the speakers are pointed within the wedge, the Communities have a wider range and can be placed much closer.</p>

<p><strong>Subs:</strong> We own 2 EV X-SUB’s that live in the work lofts to the left and right of downstage. The subs supply the low end frequencies to both the main and projection systems.</p>

<p><strong>Sidefills:</strong> The 2 side fills we have, EV Zx1’s, are built into the downstage left and right walls, just where the plank design ends. The side fills are also tied to both the main speakers and the projection audio system.</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Setting up a mic</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Find out who or what you are miking and how versatile they need to be during the show. Choose a
stand and mic accordingly.</li>
  <li>Find out where the mic needs to be placed on stage. Setup the stand, attach the clip, and slip the
mic into the clip. Make sure everything within the stand is tight.</li>
  <li>If the mic is wired and you are using a boom stand,
    <ul>
      <li>Take your XLR cable and first plug the male end into the floorbox or AVP.</li>
      <li>Carry the coil to the stand (when possible, follow along with other cables going in that same
direction) and drop the coil under the center of the stand.
￼￼￼￼￼* Run the female end up the stand, wrapping it around once.</li>
      <li>As you hit the boom, make sure the cord runs over the tightening pin.</li>
      <li>Wrap the cord once more around the boom in the same direction.</li>
      <li>Plug the female end into the mic, making sure the cord has enough slack at the end so that
the mic can be easily adjusted, but not so much that the cord is hanging all over.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Always leave the cable slack at the base of the mic stand, never at the input or somewhere in
between.</li>
  <li>Try to run the cables in right angles when possible and along with other cables nearby. However,
avoid running microphone cables alongside AC power cables or SpeakOn unless absolutely
necessary;; this will generate noise in the signal.</li>
  <li>Any loose cables onstage or backstage should be taped down after soundcheck is complete, and
prior to doors opening. Remember to not tape down any mics that will need to move around during
the show.</li>
  <li>If the mic is wireless, check to make sure the battery has at least two bars for a rehearsal setting
and three for a public performance. Batteries with less than two bars should be recycled in the
“dead battery” bin.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Patchbay</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>This is where you will be connecting the signal directly to the SC48. Check the number on the floorbox or AVP input you plug into;; it should be in the format of the letter M then a sequence of ascending numbers, example: M12. Take a long-frame cable and run it from that input to whichever channel you intend to use on the mixing board. Use different colored cables to show different groups of mics (wired vs wireless or vocals vs instruments or input to split to SC48 vs booth).</li>
  <li>While patching, make sure the sound system is on by checking that the sequencer key is turned to “on” and that all its associated amps have turned on. While you’re doing this, check the subwoofer amp and turn on manually if needed.
Venue SC48 console</li>
  <li>Turn on the Venue if it hasn’t been turned on yet. Once it is on, make sure all channels have been
muted or have their faders turned down. Then turn the master fader (at the far right) up to “unity”.</li>
  <li>Select each channel you have patched mics to and label them by double clicking on the “Channel #”
in the top left corner of the onscreen interface and naming what instrument or type of mic it is (“SL Vox” for stage left vocals, or “W1” for wireless mic #1). This makes it easier to keep track of your mics and keeps you from forgetting which channels are which.</li>
  <li>If you are using a condenser mic, remember to mute the channel before turning on phantom power because the 48 volts will cause the mike to pop momentarily. If the mic is not muted, the entire house may hear an very loud and unpleasant sound. To engage phantom power:
    <ul>
      <li>Select the channel that needs the phantom.</li>
      <li>Again, make sure the channel is MUTED and the fader is down.</li>
      <li>Press the 48V button near the top of the Venue.</li>
      <li>Unmute, gain and then fader up.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Find someone assigned as or willing to temporarily be your audio assistant to test the mics. Have them first go to each mic and test that each one is working by gently tapping the grill of the mic. You are checking to see that you are getting signal to the channel;; if you see nothing, turn up the gain until you do. Remember to keep the channel muted and fader down while line checking.</li>
  <li>Once you have completed the line check, you know all your patches are correct, and you have extra time and want to do things right, you can now do your pre-soundcheck soundcheck! Ask your assistant to go back to each mic and spend more time with each one. They should speak through vocal mic and play approved instruments, one at a time, to help you set gains and test monitors.</li>
  <li>During line check, confirm that each channel is going to the appropriate main speaker (LR or C). To do this, decide whether the sound from each independent channel should be coming out of the left and right speakers, the center speaker, or all three. *As a rule, vocalists should be routed to the center speaker only, instruments to the left and right and pre-recorded music again to just left and right (although left, center, and right is also an option if you need more level). On the board, select the channel, then choose the L/R or Center assigns from the master mains routing section.</li>
  <li>Adjust the panning, limiter, comps, gate and effects (FX) as you see fit. These should all be adjusted pre-show;; turning any of these on mid-show would have to be done very gradually and strategically. When done improperly, you could lose sound completely and totally throw off a performance.</li>
  <li>Double check that the speakers are at the the right height for the show. For a lecture or panel, the center speaker can be the only one down;; instrumental performances can have the left and right speakers down. For use with the projection screen, left and right should be set below the break in the screen. For a film screening from the booth, fly the line array below the break in the screen.
At this point the basic loop of mic to patchbay to Venue to speakers is complete. There are a bunch of technical processes in there, but basic mic amplification is taking place, which can be enough for some musical performances and most lecture settings.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="using-a-di-box">Using a DI-Box</h3>
<hr />
<p>A DI-Box (Direct Input Box) allows you to connect high-impedance sources to a mixer without adverse effects. The most common uses are for connecting electric keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and most forms of instrument pickups directly to the mixer without using an amp or microphone. Plug the 1⁄4” TS cable from the instrument’s pick up into the DI (using the high-Z input) then plug an XLR into it’s output and run that to a system input (floorbox, AVP, snake, etc).
If an amp is involved, but they still want a direct line as well, you’ll have to split the source. Usually the musician will have his/her instrument plugged directly into the amp, so you’ll have to break this chain. Pull that plug from the amp and inset it into either input of your DI box. Grab a shortie instrument cable and plug it both into the second input of the DI and then back into the input of the amp.</p>
