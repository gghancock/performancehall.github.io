        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

        Handheld Tascam Tutorial
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2016</span>

    <h2 id="initial-set-up">Initial Set Up</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Press and hold the Home button to turn on the Tascam.</li>
  <li>Check the battery indicator and replace if the battery is low.</li>
  <li>Check to see if the SD card is actually in the device; if not, find one and insert it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="empty-the-memory-to-ensure-theres-enough-space-for-your-recording">Empty the memory to ensure there’s enough space for your recording:</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Press menu button to get to the menu</li>
  <li>Use plus or minus buttons to scroll down to others, press enter</li>
  <li>Scroll down to system, press enter</li>
  <li>Scroll down to quick format, press enter.  Exec, enter.</li>
  <li>“All data erased. Are you sure?” Press enter and you’re done.</li>
</ol>

<p>Press menu to get back to the record screen and press the Rec Mode button to choose an input.</p>

<p>Stay in “stereo” and then select your input under “source”.</p>

<p>Your source will be either “Internal microphone” or “External in 1&amp;2” (your XLR 1&amp;2).</p>

<p>Pressing menu again will bring you back to the home screen.</p>

<h2 id="there-are-three-methods-of-taking-a-recording-in-the-penthouse">There are three methods of taking a recording in the Penthouse:</h2>

<p><br />
<strong>Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.</li>
  <li>Make sure to test it!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam</li>
  <li>Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output</li>
  <li>On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector</li>
  <li>Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position</li>
  <li>Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam</li>
  <li>On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.</li>
  <li>Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal</li>
</ol>

<p>When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.</p>

<p>Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).</p>

<p>Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:</p>

<p>Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)</p>

<p>Then, send the file to:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>erinbrenner@uchicago.edu
</code></pre>
</div>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the website WeTransfer.com</li>
  <li>Upload the recording to the site</li>
  <li>Enter Erin’s email address (above)</li>
  <li>Enter your email address press Send.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now go put the SD card back into the handheld Tascam device and you’re done!</p>
