you will need the following equipment.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Decimator</li>
  <li>One of the Blue SDI Cables</li>

<h2 id="foh-setup">FOH Setup</h2>

<p>Set up an audio feed for the camera on the Venue with an AUX patched to an unused output (x). 
Connect AUX-out(x) to  camera’s XLR-in and make sure the audio is routed to SDI-out on the camera. 
Using the SDI cable, patch the camera into V40 at the FOH AVP under the desk. 
Set up another AUX on the Venue (should be a copy of the first) so that it is patched to another unused output (y).</p>

<h2 id="amp-room-setup">Amp Room Setup</h2>

<p>Patch V40 video output into Decimator SDI input, and connect power to the Decimator. 
Connect the Decimator’s HDMI-out to the Encoder’s (labeled “Performance Hall”) HDMI-&gt;DVI-in adapter. 
The encoder is located in the open slot in the rightmost rack towards the top. 
To run cabling you will have to feed it through the opening and go around to the back of the rack with a flashlight to make the connection. 
Take the XLR-out you patched from FOH (y) from ‘Venue Outputs’ with ¼”-&gt;XLR cable, connect it to the XLR-&gt;RCA cable, and plug the RCA-outs into the RCA-ins at the back of the  encoder. Run SDI from the Decimator’s SDI-out to SM console.</p>

<p>Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&lt;-SDI-in, SDI-out(1)&lt;-SDI-in (make loop)</p>

<h2 id="stage-manager-console-setup">Stage Manager Console Setup</h2>
<p>Set up a second Decimator with SDI-in taken from the Amp Room SDI run. 
Connect power to the Decimator, and send HDMI-out to Crestron panel’s HDMI-in. Enter Technician Mode at Crestron panel (5540) and route “SM Input” to all the TVs you want to use for overflow viewing.</p>

<p>Decimator Settings: HDMI-out&lt;-SDI-in</p>

<h2 id="theater-eastwest">Theater East/West</h2>
<p>Remove the Decoder box from below the TV in either Theater West or Theater East.
(When restoring these, take care with cable/port matches: Yellow Component cable -&gt; Yellow Component output, Black/Silver Audio cable -&gt; Red audio output)</p>

<h2 id="mezzanine">Mezzanine</h2>
<p>Connect the ethernet cable to left port under Erin’s desk (the right port is disconnected) and connect the other end to “Primary” on the Decoder box. 
Plug in power for the TV, and plug the DC-Adapter into an outlet and connect it to the Decoder box. 
Run Component-outs from the Decoder to Component-ins on back of TV. 
Turn on TV and set to Component source. 
Run HDMI-out from the Decoder to HDMI-in on back of TV. 
The following must be done quickly: using remote, select 1080i-out on Decoder; switch TV source to HDMI; hit accept/confirm on Decoder remote.</p>
