  <p>Always check the <strong>Google Calendar</strong> to see what company you’ll be working with for your shift. If you’re lucky, the visiting artists have been responsive, thought ahead, and had the foresight to fully plan out their performance details.  If so, a basic rundown of what needs to be done will be in the calendar notes section. Make a mental note of these tasks and be prepared to accomplish all. Ask questions ahead of time if you have any, such as “Do we need to check out any gear from the cage?” or “What time is the talent arriving?”</p>

<p><strong>Clocking in and out</strong> is important; don’t mess this part up or HR will start to dislike you as a person. They are the ones that write your checks, so seriously, don’t mess this part up. It’s your responsibility to remember to do this. If for some reason you forgot to clock in or out at the right time, immediately send an email to Erin detailing the time/date that you did clock in/out vs the time/date that you were supposed to clock in/out.  Words like “today”, “yesterday” and “last Monday” don’t cut it.</p>

<p>As stated in the <a href="/2016/04/12/stagehand-guide.html">Stagehand Guide</a>, you should dress appropriately to each crew call.</p>

<p>If your shift is scheduled at the same time as an event on the <strong>Performance</strong> calendar, do not fail to dress the part.  If you are normally backstage, you must wear black head to toe. If you know you will be sitting at front of house, you can either wear all blacks or professional clothing.</p>

<p>If your shift is scheduled at the same time as something on the <strong>Rehearsal</strong> calendar, feel free to relax those standards a bit.  If nothing else is scheduled coinciding with your shift, you can expect tech work and should wear more comfortable clothes that you don’t mind getting dirty.</p>

<p>If you complete your tasks quickly and see others still working, go lend them a hand. This is not a union house–you can cross between departments. Whoever you may be, meet up with the rest of the crew or the members of a visiting production team. Understand what is expected of you throughout the show.</p>

<h3 id="during-the-show">During the Show</h3>

<p>Even if you do not have anything to do for a while, do not busy yourself with homework, reading, or facebook. Your actions distract audience members and artists while you end up looking lazy to the other professionals. Watch and pay attention to the show. You never know what is going to happen on stage and if you’re not paying attention, you’ll miss your cue. If you cannot spare four or six hours to work a show, then you should not take the shift.</p>

<p>Be extra quiet while a performance is taking place.  The hall was designed with acoustics in mind. Someone speaking at a normal volume on stage can be heard throughout the entire room.  Remember this when talking through clear com at the FOH position, especially during quieter parts of the show. With a headset on, what might seem like a whisper to you can be heard by everyone around you.</p>

<p>If for any reason you need to walk away from your post for a moment, let the rest of the crew know by saying, “[your name] going off headset.” Give the other crew members a second to respond in case they have something important to say before you go. When you return, let them know you’re back on.</p>

<p>Always, <em>always</em> act professionally. Your actions reflect the entire crew, your bosses, the venue and building.</p>
