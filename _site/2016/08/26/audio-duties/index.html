  ### Before the Show

* When you arrive, uncover and turn on the Venue SC48; store the cover under the console.
* Turn on the sequencer (the key in the upper section of the left rack in the patchbay). Also, turn on the sub amp (the lower right hand section of the rack) by pressing the on button.
* Confirm with visiting artists their music, video, and whether they need any equipment.
* Set up your archival recording and test that it is getting level.
  * Always set up a backup wireless mic on a straight stand off stage left (in a place where the audience won’t see them every time the stage door opens) to easily deal with any last minute mic requests.
  * Make sure the batteries are fresh if you are about to go into a show.
  * Use half-life batteries or rechargeable batteries if you are in a rehearsal.
  * Throw dead batteries into the dead battery bin.

* **Microphones**

    * Set up requested microphones backstage and/or onstage.
    * Fly speakers in to the appropriate height based on the type of performance.
    * Fly in the banners if there will be amplified music or speaking.  Make sure you do not fly banners in front of the stage camera or the projection window if projection will be in use.
    * If using wireless mics, check all batteries and consider sleeving the mics.
    * Patch microphones in the patch bay from your “M” inputs on stage to the Venue by using the TRS cables hanging in the amp room (the red, green, and black cords).

* **Monitors**

    * Always set up monitors if someone will be singing through a microphone on stage.  Often, instrumental groups with multiple mics will want monitors in order to hear each other better.
    * Patch monitors in the speakon patchbay, from Venue outputs to stage inputs, using the short CROSSWIRED speakon cables found in the amp room only. DO NOT use regular speakon cable - they are wired differently and can damage the gear.

* **Soundcheck**

  * Before the band arrives, if possible, do a line check to make sure that each microphone and monitor is passing signal.  To line check, have your audio assistant speak into each mic, one at a time, in order to pre-set general gains. Deal with phantom needs and troubleshoot any patching issues.  Next, have your assistant stand near each monitor while you send signal, one at a time, to confirm the monitors are patched correctly.
  * It is good practice to ring out the monitors before the artists arrive as well.
  * Once the band arrives, start sound checking each mic, focusing on one instrument at a time. If you are checking drums, have the drummer go through his whole kit, one drum/cymbal at a time, while you work with the EQ, comp, gate, etc for each one.  After you have them all dialed in, ask him/her to play the whole set so that you can further tweak (pan, groups, hi-pass, etc).
  * Make sure the musician is hearing the right amount of everything through their monitor; don’t move on to the next musician until each person is happy. If they specifically ask for “everything” it’s important that you don’t give them everything.  In this situation, only give them the most important aspects for clarity’s sake (themselves, vocals, kick drum, lead guitar, whatever that might be).  If you give them everything, they’ll need more of everything and it will become a huge mess.
  * If you are mixing a digital instrument such as keyboard, dj rig or sampler, ask them to reproduce their loudest patch so that you can set your gain to that level.
  * When you finish with the last musician and everyone seems happy with their rough mixes, ask the whole group to play a half song together while you walk the room to hear the mix from different listening perspectives - tweak issues accordingly.  When the group stops playing, they will have many requests, deal with each request, one at a time.  Once everyone seems happy, ask them to try a different half song and repeat the whole process until they are happy with the stage mix and you are happy with the house mix.
  * Make sure audio cables (only cables that will stay in place for the whole show) are taped down when in high traffic walk ways - brown gaff tape onstage, black offstage.
  * Determine if there will be any videographers in house and whether or not they need a board feed. Set that up for them ahead of time.  If the videographer shows up after doors are open, you will not be able to send them a feed down to the lower level.  They will have to record from the upper level next to FOH. Make sure their power cables do not run across the house walkways.

### During the Show

* If you are tasked with recording the performance, remember to PRESS RECORD(!!) in the minutes leading up to the start of the show. Make sure the device is actually recording and picking up signal.
* Follow along with the program, and any notes you’ve taken, to make sure you turn the correct mic on each time someone is about to speak and then mute it when they travel off stage.
* Communicate with the stage manager, especially when mics are coming on and off the stage throughout the show so you know which mics to take live.
* Use good judgment when deciding whose mics to mute during panels and Q&A’s. Sometime panelists will make a lot of noise when they aren’t speaking, so it might be good to mute their mics if someone else is speaking for a long period of time. To do this well, you will have to have all your fingers on the mutes or faders ready to pull the trigger before they decide to speak up.
* Use your headphones to solo channels in order to find any problem areas that you notice now but didn’t notice during soundcheck.
* Leave your ClearCom in a visible place so that you can see calls coming in. The stage manager may need to reach you to communicate, and without that visual you may never know.

---

### After the Show

* Mute the audio console and head down to stage to begin strike. Play some quiet music if you’d like.
* Before doing anything, attempt to troubleshoot any issues you realized during the show. Test suspect mics, cables, patches, systems, channels, etc before striking. Immediately, send an email to Erin about the problem, when it happened, how you dealt with it and the current status.  Leave the broken gear up in #243 on the secondary desk in Erin’s office.
* Strike all mics, monitors, stands and cable and restore them to their default “home” positions. Remember to keep mic clips with their mic and mic bag, not with the stand.
* Pull up all your tape from the floor.
* Remove your hard patches in the amp room, but leave default patches (hanging house mics).
* Turn off sequencer and sub amp in the amp room.
* Help the rest of the crew with clean up of the stage as well as striking any marley, soft goods or other staging that might still be in progress.
* Confirm that the hall/backstage is clean, everything has been restored for the next morning, all systems are shut down and all doors to the hall spaces are closed and locked.
* Make sure the projector is off, the boards are both off and the hall is set to “night” before leaving.
* If you made an archival recording:
  * In the hall, normalize the file, gain it, then normalize it again before exporting it. Save it to the PH recordings folder and send it to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
  * If you’re using the Tascam, upload the files to the computer in the recording booth using the card reader in the USB port. Log into the Performance Hall user, store the files in a folder on the desktop called “Archival Recordings” and name the file by show/group and date.  Send the files to Erin via the website WeTransfer.com.
* If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.
* If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.
