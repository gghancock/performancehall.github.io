        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

        Setting Up a DI-Box
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Aug 2016</span>

    <p>A DI-Box (Direct Input Box) allows you to connect high-impedance sources to a mixer without adverse effects.
The most common uses are for connecting electric keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and most forms of instrument pickups directly to the mixer without using an amp or microphone.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Plug the 1⁄4” TS cable from the instrument’s pick up into the DI (using the high-Z input)</li>
  <li>Plug an XLR into the output of the DI and run that to a system input (floorbox, AVP, snake, etc).</li>
</ol>

<p>If an amp is involved, but they still want a direct line as well, you’ll have to split the source.
Usually the musician will have his/her instrument plugged directly into the amp, so you’ll have to break this chain.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Pull the plug from the amp input and insert it into either input of your DI box.</li>
  <li>Grab a short instrument cable (1/4 inch TS usually) and plug into the THRU port of the DI and then back into the input of the amp.</li>
</ol>
