        <h1>The Performance Hall's Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>
    The Performance Hall is committed to providing a welcoming and harassment-
    free environment for people of all races, sexual orientations, gender
    statuses, physical dispositions, and beliefs. We believe in having an
    archived and publicly available set of guidelines as a necessary and
    important part of attaining this type of environment. Please take a moment
    to read ours below.
</p>

<h2>Costumer Service</h2>

<p>
    At the Logan Center, we maintain a high standard or client and patron
    service (both are our customers). The following bullet points are basic
    tips for interacting with patrons, talent, external crews, building staff,
    and anyone else who may be in the Logan Center.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always greet the client and patrons warmly and maintain a pleasant
    atmosphere</li>
  <li>Display sincere interest in helping the client and patrons</li>
  <li>Motivate other employees to be productive at all times, especially when
    others are in the space</li>
  <li>If you do not know the answer to a question, state that you do not know
    and that you will work on finding the answer. Bring the question to the
    appropriate person or group of people, and proceed from there. Always follow
    up to give an update on your efforts.</li>
  <li>ALWAYS BE POLITE to everyone, all the time, no matter what. This means
    coworkers, external crew, talent, support staff, patrons, supervisors,
    faculty, staff, strangers, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Disability Sensitivity</h2>

<p>
    When speaking to people with disabilities, always use people-first language.
    Group designations are inappropriate because they do not reflect the
    individuality, equality or dignity of the person.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Address the person with a disability directly, not their companion or
    caregiver. If they are using a wheelchair, kneel to speak with them at eye
    level.</li>
  <li>Instead of asking the person about their disability (which is illegal),
    ask “How may I assist you?”. Focus on their needs, not their disability.
  </li>
  <li>If for any reason a problem arises and the person with a disability cannot
    easily access the facility, please attempt to serve them with personalized
    service.</li>
  <li>Politely address and assist those with disabilities without being
    patronizing or demeaning.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indicators of quality performance include</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Timely arrival for shifts</li>
  <li>Articulating clearly and listening to clients</li>
  <li>Maintaining professional attitude with clients and patrons at all times
    </li>
  <li>Making appropriate decisions and accepting consequences of actions</li>
  <li>Accurate interpretation of Logan Center policies and procedures</li>
</ul>

    We welcome your feedback on this and we thank you for working with us to
    make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who visits
    us. Contact us via phone (773-834-2385) or email (erinbrenner@uchicago.edu)

        Lighting Board Operator Duties
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">28 Aug 2016</span>

    <h3 id="before-the-show">Before the Show</h3>

<ul>
  <li>When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.</li>
  <li>Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).</li>
  <li>Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.</li>
  <li>Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.</li>
  <li>Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.</li>
  <li>Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.</li>
  <li>If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.</li>
  <li>Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).</li>
  <li>Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).</li>
  <li>Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.</li>
  <li>Take notes on lighting cues needed.</li>
  <li>Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.</li>
  <li>Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.</li>
  <li>Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.</li>
  <li>If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.</li>
  <li>If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.</li>
  <li>If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.</li>
  <li>Make sure <strong>EP LOCKOUT</strong> is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.</li>
  <li>Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="during-the-show">During the Show</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Follow along with the program.</li>
  <li>Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.
Communicate with the stage manager.</li>
  <li>If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.</li>
  <li>On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.</li>
  <li>On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.</li>
  <li>At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="after-the-show">After the Show</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.</li>
  <li>Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.</li>
  <li>Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.</li>
  <li>Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.</li>
  <li>If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.</li>
  <li>If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.</li>
