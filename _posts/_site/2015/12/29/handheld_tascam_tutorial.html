<p><br />
<strong>Plan to use the Tascam’s built-in mic as default because it is much easier and you can place it anywhere.</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>To record using the mic, all you need to do is press record twice to begin the recording.</li>
  <li>Make sure to test it!</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If the group specifically wants you to take a board feed:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect 2 XLRs between Stereo Alt Out on the back of the board and the Tascam</li>
  <li>Press the little AB button near the master fader to enable the output</li>
  <li>On the side of the Tascam, choose “Line” under the the Ext In selector</li>
  <li>Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If the group specifically asks you to get a recording from the hanging house mics:</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Start in the patch bay and connect the “hanging house mics 2 &amp; 3” to the AVP nearest your mix position</li>
  <li>Connect two gender changers and XLRs from that AVP to the Tascam</li>
  <li>On the side of the Tascam, choose “Mic+Phantom” under the Ext In selector.</li>
  <li>Test the mics and ensure you’re getting signal</li>
</ol>

<p>When the performance ends, press the stop button and eject the SD card.</p>

<p>Bring the SD card to the computer in the recording booth or at FOH and insert it into the USB SD card reader (or insert it into any cage laptop checked out).</p>

<p>Download the content to the Archival Audio file folder and use the naming convention as follows:</p>

<p>Year.Month.Date_Description_Engineer.mp3 (Example: 14.3.19_FOTA_Kyle.mp3)</p>

<p>Then, send the file to:</p>

<pre><code>erinbrenner@uchicago.edu

  <li>Upload the recording to the site</li>
