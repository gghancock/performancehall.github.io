Out of all the members of the crew on the show call, congratulations, you have the most duties. You are the liaison between the crew and the performers. All stage management duties follow a logic of making a show run smoothly. Communicate with your crew and the visiting production team and you will be fine.

###Before the Show

* When you arrive, go up to Erin’s office and get the stage management keys. Keep them on you for the rest of the night. Don’t forget to return them at the end of the night.  
* Open the space, propping open backstage doors and the green room.
* Unlock the backstage cabinet.  Make sure it stays closed throughout the day.
* Turn on Scene Control, the stage manager console, and the amp room sequencer (plus sub amp). 
* Turn on your backstage monitor at the stage manager console. Make sure that there are no banners in the way and that the camera is in focus so you can see the stage. If you can’t see anything on your monitor, check in with your supervisor or other crew members. They can help you fix it.
* Meet with the board operators and visiting production team. While the board ops are in charge of discussing their specific needs, you should have a general grasp of what is happening on stage.
* Find out if the group has any digital materials. While digital files for projection or audio playback should be handed over to your board ops, digital signage for the lobby LCD screens will be inserted by you at the Stage Manager console. (More on this later)
* Alternately, you can send the live camera feed to the lobby monitors after rehearsals are finished, once the stage has cleared and house is open.
* Get a copy of the program. If there is none, speak with someone from the team and build one out. Take notes on entrances, exits, and cues (both light and sound). Some groups will provide their own cue sheet. Determine the entire show flow:
  * What time is the show supposed to start?
  * What time should the doors open to the public?
  * Is there an intermission? If so, for how long?
  * When is the show scheduled to end?
  * Who will be walking onto stage, when and from where? Do they need mics?

* Set up your clearcom backstage. Your headset, pack, and cable are in the drawer in the stage management console. Spares are in the upstage right cabinet. 
  * Do a clearcom check with your board operators. Have them go on headset. Check if you can hear one another, your volumes are set properly and your call buttons work.

###During Doors

* Right after doors are open, put the DO NOT OPEN THIS DOOR sign on the back of the downstage left door. From this point on, YOU are the only person allowed to open this door. DO NOT let anyone (even Bill or Obama) run past you onto stage without clearing it with lighting and sound first. FOH relies on you heavily to start the show only after they are ready. Own this door, it’s yours. 
* Walk over to the green room and inform performers that the house is now open. 
* Five minutes prior to show, give a 5 minute warning to members of the cast and crew. If performers request more time, let your house staff know if they need to hold doors or if the show will start late.
* Collect your first performers backstage. Keep them backstage and ready to start.
* When the show is ready to start, tell your friends at FOH to begin the process of house lights to half. This will notify the audience to take their seats and prepare for the start of the show. Allow one minute for everyone to get settled and then request the lighting operator to bring the house lights all the way out and into the first lighting look - usually stage lights up.
* Wait for confirmation that the light change is in progress and send out your performers.
* Once the performers are out, close the inner vestibule doors as to isolate sound from the hall.

###During the Show

* Follow along with the program.  Cross out movements/acts as they finish to stay on track.
* Watch the backstage left monitor for stage movement. Be ready and open the door if someone is walking offstage.  Make sure you actually open the door before they get close to it. 
* If handing out wireless microphones, remember to check that they are on/have full battery strength before handing them out. Confirm with your sound board op as to which mic you’ve given out. Make sure you get the mic back when the person exits stage, turn it off if it won’t be in use again.
* If you are nervous the person using the mic will accidentally turn it off during their performance, or if the sound board operator has requested it, put a sleeve on the microphone. 
* Help nervous actors, musicians and other talent by being a calming force. Exude confidence. 
* You are the backstage point person throughout the entire show, help talent with anything they need - water, towel, safety pin, costume change, even a bucket to puke in (use a lined garbage can).

###After the Show

* Return your ClearCom & cable to its drawer.
* Help others strike what needs to be struck.
* Make the hall usable for the next day’s crew. For example, if you used the piano but the next crew will not, return it to instrument storage. If you didn’t use the piano but they will, bring it out. 
* Clean up and throw away any garbage or show specific paperwork. Empty the trash bin backstage. 
* Try to return any personal items left behind.  If the group is long gone, leave these items with the lost and found at the North Desk and tell the building manager on duty. 
* Once everyone has cleared out, make sure all 3 entrances are closed and locked, as well as the green room entrances, storage closets, and stage door.
* If you turned on scene control, turn it off and reconnect its key with the stage manager key set.
* **IMPORTANT**: DO NOT FORGET to return the stage manager key set to Erin’s office. The next morning’s crew will not be able to do anything without this key set and will have to hunt you down. Public shaming will ensue.  
* If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, logistical mishaps, or mischievous deviants, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report instead if you are shift leading.
