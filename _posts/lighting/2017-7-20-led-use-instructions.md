## Directions for Using LEDS:

Setting Up Power  

* Tap the aux console touchscreen
* Tap "Relay Controls"
* Make sure the Relays 211 and 218 are turned on

At the Console  

* Select Channels 101-108 (or some subset thereof) and put them at some intensity (full, or 50%) as you would a conventional fixture
* In the upper left set of buttons to the right of the faders, hit "color" so that the LED next to it is lit up
* On the bottom bar of the screen you should see four boxes: each corresponds to one of the four encoders (circular knobs) at the top of the console
* The first box should say RGB. If it does not, spin the leftmost encoder until it does
* The next three encoders correspond to red, green, and blue respectively. Turn them right and left to mix the color you want

All other functionality with the LEDs such as recording them into a cue is exactly the same as it has been in the past with conventional fixtures.
