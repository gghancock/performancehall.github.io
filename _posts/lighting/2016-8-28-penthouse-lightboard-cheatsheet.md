###Startup

* Turn on board via power switch under front lip of board

    * Make sure all cables are plugged in first.
* Board will take a while to start up
* Use the top bank of sliders (they are labeled on the board) to create different lighting looks in the room and shift between them

###If you want to bring up specific lights, refer to the “magic sheet” image further down this page.

* Type in the number corresponding to the lights you want to bring up on the number pad.
* Then hit [@] and a value from 0-100 and then [Enter] to set their brightness.
* Hit the [Undo] key several times to turn them off and release control of them.

###To shut the board down

* Move the mouse to the top of the screen so the menu bar appears, click on the File menu and then Click Exit.
* Then click the power button in the lower left corner of the screen, to the right of where it says “Run Palette.”
* The board will then (slowly) shut down.

###If the Board Crashes

* You can hard power down the board by holding down the power button.
* **Only do this if you absolutely need to!**
