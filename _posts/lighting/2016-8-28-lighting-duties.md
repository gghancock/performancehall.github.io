### Before the Show

* When you arrive, uncover the Strand light board and the auxiliary console and store their covers on the shelf directly underneath them.
* Turn on the Strand Light Palette. Make sure you are in the Standard.spf show file and in Cue Only mode (unless you are utterly desperate to work in Tracking mode).
* Bring the house, stage (OL) and backstage lights up so those entering the space can see.
* Turn the auxiliary console to NIGHT and activate EP LOCKOUT.
* Make sure the vestibule lights are still on.
* Turn the ghost lights on and back off by pressing FOH twice in the work lights section.
* If there are random lights stuck on, first try Release PB (playback not peanut butter) on the Strand. If that doesn’t work, return to the Aux Console and choose ALL OFF before returning to NIGHT.  This should reset all the dimmers.
* Determine if there needs to be a lot of talking between the lighting operator and the stage manager (i.e. a stage manager calling cues from FOH). If so, I strongly suggest you move the lighting board to the followspot booth. Bring a ClearCom beltpack, headset and cable. Only do this if you have enough time (allow 30 min to fully get reset up there).
* Walk around the house and check that none of the house lights have burnt out. Do a channel check to make sure all stage lights are functional. If not, a lamp is probably out, and you’ll need to replace it (refer to the Lighting Basics manual).
* Meet with the stage manager, sound board op, visiting artists and crew.
* Take notes on lighting cues needed.
* Determine if any specials are needed for the show. If they are, spike the stage in those locations, bring them up from the RFU, go up to the catwalks, and focus them. Lighting units that are specials are marked with yellow spike tape on the pipe next to them. Once focused, confirm the looks with the visiting artists/crew.
* Confirm with the visiting artists/crew the entire flow of the show in terms of lighting.
* Determine if the weed lights should stay on throughout the performance or if the house should to go completely dark. The extra light allows late comers to find seats and audience members to read their programs. If it’s a film screening though, you will turn them off in order to go totally dark.
* If you plan to change a number of board settings/reprogram subs/re-patch/record cues, create a new showfile for the show.
* If you have time and are confident about the show going as planned, record a cue list for the show on the lighting board. Otherwise, you can record all the lighting looks that you will need on the twelve submasters/looks on SubPage 2 or 3.
* If you need to turn off the lights on everyone, announce “Going dark!” and await for confirmation before you actually go dark.
* Make sure **EP LOCKOUT** is enabled on the auxiliary panel before doors open to the public. If you forget this, anyone may walk into a vestibule and change the stage/house looks.
* Lower the backstage work lights to about 15%. Confirm level is ok with the Stage Manager.

### During the Show

* Follow along with the program.
* Change the lights according to your notes from earlier.
Communicate with the stage manager.
* If there is an intermission, bring stage lights down and then house lights up at the end of the first half. Usually some crossfade is acceptable (once under 40%).  Other times, for a more dramatic effect, you would want to go totally black on stage before bringing the house lights up.
* On your cue, at the end of intermission, bring the house lights down to half.
* On your cue, bring the house lights out and the stage lights up.
* At the end of the show, do it all again. Bring the stage lights down and then the house lights up.

### After the Show

* Once the house is mostly empty, bring up the stage work lights.
* Help the rest of the crew clean up, strike and set up for the next day.
* Once everything is cleaned, closed up, doors locked, systems off and everyone ready to leave, turn off the light board using the proper shutdown procedure.
* Retrieve the covers for the Strand and AUX console from and cover the boards.
* If you have been holding the Stage Manager key set, return it to Erin’s desk.
* If you ran into any technical troubleshooting, send Erin an email with the nature of the issue, when it happened, the troubleshooting steps you followed and the outcome. Send a full show report if you are shift leading.
