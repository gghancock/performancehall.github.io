title: Stagehand Duties
---

As a stagehand, you are most likely on call because there is at least one set change. Set changes in the Performance Hall tend to include at least one of the following:

* Setting or striking chairs, music stands, the piano (don’t forget to lock it!), the lectern, microphones (and their cables), music stand lights (and their cables), etc.
* Assistance with costume changes

Other duties include:

* Helping other crew members with their set-ups.
Giving time warnings to actors (“five minute calls” passed on from your stage manager).
* Retrieving talent from greenroom or other hiding places.

*You must wear all black. Be alert and listen to your stage manager.*

###Before the Show

* Set up a Clearcom for yourself backstage right or wherever you’ve been positioned.
* Meet with the stage manager, board ops, and visiting production team.
* Get a program and take notes.
* Go over scene changes with performers and your stage manager.
* Make sure everything you will be moving to has been first spiked and that you understand which spike colors are associated with which change, which pieces are coming on and off and when.


###During the Show

* Sit quietly backstage on headset, paying attention to the show. Do not talk over clearcom while others are being held in standby and waiting for go calls.
* Don’t pay attention to your phone!
* As your scene change approaches, confirm with your stage manager who is handling which task.
* During your scene changes:
  * Move quickly and with purpose.
  * Do not talk to others on stage, it looks unprofessional. As a stagehand, you are supposed to be almost invisible to the audience. If you need to confer, do it backstage and beforehand.

###After the Show

* Help others strike and clean.
* Remember to remove all spikes from stage and backstage.
* Make sure all the tools in the storage spaces are organized properly before locking up.
* Take a quick check of batteries, tape and other consumables to make sure we're not almost out. If we are low on any of these commonly used supplies, send an email to Erin to order more.
* Make sure all the backstage areas are clean and clear and that nothing is left sitting out that shouldn’t be there.
* Confirm that doors are locked and all systems are off.
* Get confirmation from your shift leader that everything is complete and ask permission to clock off.
