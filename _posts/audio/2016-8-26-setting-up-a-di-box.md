A DI-Box (Direct Input Box) allows you to connect high-impedance sources to a mixer without adverse effects.
The most common uses are for connecting electric keyboards, guitars, bass guitars and most forms of instrument pickups directly to the mixer without using an amp or microphone.

1. Plug the 1⁄4” TS cable from the instrument’s pick up into the DI (using the high-Z input)
2. Plug an XLR into the output of the DI and run that to a system input (floorbox, AVP, snake, etc).

If an amp is involved, but they still want a direct line as well, you’ll have to split the source.
Usually the musician will have his/her instrument plugged directly into the amp, so you’ll have to break this chain.

1. Pull the plug from the amp input and insert it into either input of your DI box.
2. Grab a short instrument cable (1/4 inch TS usually) and plug into the THRU port of the DI and then back into the input of the amp.
