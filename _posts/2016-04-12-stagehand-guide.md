###The Basics
* Always arrive 10 minutes early for your call. If your call starts at 9am, that means you start working at 9am. Give yourself enough time to clock on, tool up, and get ready for work.

* Remember to stay busy during your work call. If you have nothing to do, ask your other crew members and supervisor if they need help doing anything. 
*If no one needs help, keep yourself busy by working on something else like tidying backstage or the storage closets, sweeping or mopping the stage, returning tools to their homes, or organizing gels in the catwalks. 
* If you’ve finished cleaning and your co-workers/supervisor still don’t need assistance, either ask for a break or spend the time getting more familiar with systems that you might not yet understand. 
* If someone walks into the space while you are staring at your phone, book or computer, it reflects badly on the entire crew and building.

###What to Wear (and not wear)

####Appropriate Dress
* Closed Toe shoes (no flip flops or birkenstocks)
* Clothes you can move comfortably in
* Full length pants
* Appropriate tools for the job (flashlight, crescent wrench, etc)
* Long hair is tied back

####Inappropriate Dress (DO NOT WEAR)
* Open-toed shoes
* High heels
* Dangly jewelry
* Skirts or dresses
* Torn or dirty clothes (unless it’s a tech day)

####More Notes
* If you’re working a show call and/or will be positioned backstage, wear all black (or as close as you can possibly get) with black/dark soft-soled shoes. 
* NO shorts are allowed (unless it's a tech day but even then, consider your knees). 
* If you’re working at front of house, wear all black OR dark professional clothes: button down shirt, dress pants, nice shoes.

###Communication
Don’t be afraid to ask questions. If you don’t know how to do something, ask. It’s way better to spend more time on something during setup than to do something incorrectly if you’re unsure; we will all pay for it at showtime. Double/triple check everything you do and point out concerns or inconsistencies to the other crew members and supervisor. 

Don't be afraid to talk to those renting/using the spaces. Consider the implications of user requests before saying yes or no. If these requests are outside of your domain, bring that question to the right person:

Examples: 

**Can we get access to the greenroom?** 
        
        Yes.
        
**Can we hang a curtain here?** 
        
        I’ll have to ask my Stage Manager or Supervisor.
        
**Can we get a 2nd wireless mic?** 
        
        I’ll ask the audio engineer for you.
        
**Can we get a spotlight here?** 
        
        I’ll ask the lighting engineer for you. 
        
**Can we get a table in the lobby for check in?** 
        
        Yes. Then, go grab a table from 065 and bring it up to the lobby. 
        If you’re short on time, or can’t follow through, reach out 
        to Operations for support.
        
**Can I peek through the stage door while people are in the house?** 
        
        No. Guide them to look at the video monitor at the Stage Manager 
        Console instead (you have control over the camera, so you could 
        scan the audience to get a feel for how crowded the house is). 
        Otherwise, if they need a better view, tell them to sneak out 
        into the lower vestibule and enter at the lower level entrance.
        
**Can I get a stage picture through the stage door?** 
        
        Tell them to hold while you ask the person in charge of the event 
        to approve this request. Opening the stage door for any reason 
        other than an entrance will distract the audience, but in the 
        end it’s up to the person running the show. 

###General Shift Etiquette

While lightheartedness and laughter are crucial and help us all get through long hours of hard labor, remember that you’re here to work. Try not to goof off too much while on the clock. Socialize after work.

If you are doing something that could potentially affect the entire crew, announce to everyone what you are doing. For example, if you are working in the catwalks or in a genie, shout, “Working overhead!” If you are bringing in a lineset, say, “Lineset moving!” or “U3 flying in!” Before you turn off all the lights off on stage or in the house, you should shout “Going dark!”. Always wait for acknowledgement from others in the space in the form of “Thank you!” before executing the change. 

If there are patrons or members of the cast on stage or in the house and you need to be working up in the catwalks on lighting, check with your supervisor first. It may be better to wait until the space is empty. However, if time is tight, as it can often be, you may have to work despite others being in the way. Make sure those directly below you have cleared the area before continuing to work over them.

###Finding Covers

If you cannot make a shift for some reason, text/email other members of the crew to find a replacement. Let your manager know immediately. Your shift is your responsibility, so even if you have other things going on, get sick, injured or realize your have a paper due in the morning, you must find a cover because the show must go on. Be very careful when finding a cover because they must have the same skill set you do in order to do your job. Double check with this person the day before the shift to make sure they are still covering for you. If for some reason they fall through, it falls on you. Even one “incident” could put you into suspension. 


###Physical Hazards / How to Be Safe

* Be smart about lifting heavy objects! 
  * If you can’t lift it yourself, ask someone to help. 
  * If you are lifting something onto a cart, bring the cart close to the object you are moving. 
  * The less carrying, the less strain on your back. As always, lift with your knees and legs, not your back.

* Always confirm that lighting or audio equipment is off before plugging or unplugging anything. 
* When using a blade, always cut away from yourself and others; be careful and use common sense. 
* Wear gloves and long sleeves when planning to touch hot lighting fixtures. 
* Always wear shoes while on the stage. The stage floor splinters terribly and nobody wants that. 

###Closing the Hall

When closing the hall, don’t ask if you can clock out or go home until:

* Everything is back in its place
* Stage/backstage/FOH are totally clean
* Everything is setup for the next event
* All the systems are shut down and the three sets of exterior doors (as well as auxiliary doors to the storage closet, instrument storage, and green room) are closed and locked securely. 

###Door Stops:
Always push door stops into the vestibules, not out into the hallways! This is exactly how they grow legs and walk away (/ get stolen by... other departments). Also, push them to the sides of the vestibules so other people walking in don’t trip over them. 

###Piano Safety
The Steinway is a big object on little wheels! 
Move it slowly and be aware of all hazards AT ALL TIMES. 
Do not allow it to come close to running into doors, door frames and walls or over items such as cables, curtain, or the little metal thresholds for the door closers. 
Immediately lock it down after moving it by twisting the pins on the two wheels near the piano keys clockwise until tight.

After you have locked down the piano, tri-fold the cover lengthwise, and then roll it up and store it backstage. 
Next, lift the cover off the piano keys. 
Then, slide the built in music stand toward the keys and lift it up into place. 
Ask the the pianist whether they would like the piano lid to be down, at half-stick, or at full-stick. 
Always double check that the wheels are locked before lifting the lid. 
The full stick sits in the square hole. The half stick sits in the circular hole. 
Be extremely careful when handling the piano. 

Always have at least two people moving the piano; a third is helpful to open doors and move anything that’s in the way. 
These two people moving the piano, or at least one of them, should be from our team. 
If you see a group trying to move a piano on their own, please step in and put your hands on that piano until it is in place, the wheels are locked, and everyone has stepped away. 
Kindly open the lid for them. 

###Stage and Spiking Things
Remember to lock the stage wall panels. 
If they need to be open at an angle where they cannot lock, sandbag them. 
Sandbags can be found in the amp room. If you see bags sitting out, put them back in the amp room. 
Confirm that the panels are locked by pushing them gently once or twice. 

Again, double and triple check your work, if necessary, to avoid messing up an entire show. Take your time, ask questions, do it right the first time and you won’t have to be embarrassed when it fails or waste everyone’s time while doing it again.

Typically, spike the upstage offstage corners of objects.
Spike the piano with L’s on the upstage and offstage sides of the legs. 
Spike music stands with T’s directly under the vertical of the stand. Have the long line of the T point the direction the stand faces. If you have more than one stage change, color code each setup. You can even write a note to yourself on the spike tape. Use sharpie or pen and keep it simple. If there is going to be a lot of movement/big set changes, it is a good idea to draw up a stage plot of each change and label the page with the appropriate color of spike tape. If marley is down, put a piece of clear tape over each spike to make sure it doesn’t get danced off. 

###Know Your Stage Directions
**Stage Left and Stage Right**

When speaking stage directions, you always refer to it from the artist’s perspective. If you are standing on stage, facing the audience, your left is stage left and right is stage right. If you are standing in the audience, or at FOH, and you are calling out stage movement, your left will become “stage right” and your right is “stage left”. Same rule applies to someone standing backstage left and looking onto stage from the wing; away from you should be referred to as “stage right”.

**On and Off Stage**

Sometimes, if you’re standing at a funny angle, up in the genie, or it doesn’t matter which direction you’re going, it may be easier for you to explain yourself using “on stage” and “off stage.”  
“Off stage” is always referring to the direction further away from the center line of the stage and towards the wings in either direction. 
Moving something “on stage” would mean to move it toward the center line from the wings. 

**Upstage and Downstage**

Upstage is on the stage further away from the audience, so towards the 'back' of the stage.
Downstage is further towards the audience, so towards the 'front' of the stage.

**Flying in and out**

This is how we refer to things that are moving up and down. Battens and banners fly in when they are moving down from the ceiling and they fly out when moving back up toward the ceiling. Always call out, in your loudest speaking voice, to the whole room when you are flying battens in or out. Example: Batten 2 flying out! Or U6 flying in! The response should be: Thank you flying in! or Thank you U6!
